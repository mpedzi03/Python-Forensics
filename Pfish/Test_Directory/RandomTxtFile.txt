CHANING SIZE OF DOTS
LinePanel (in the line panel class)
	private int pointSize
	public get & set 
	(also initialize in constructor)
	
	public void paintComponent  (currently of size 10 points)
		g.drawOval use pointSize
		g.drawLine from prev point to the (curX, curY) location

in the frame (where we have the actionlistener listening to somebody wanting to change the set pointSize)

Frame
	actionListener
		tell the line panel to setPointSize

**last one (draw your connecting line)
g.drawline needs to be in the right place

mouseMoved
	e.getX, e.getY() (tells you where the mouse is currentl located
	curX = e.getX(), curY = e.getY()
	repaint()

**whether or not to add points**
Question about drawing or not drawing lines
public void paintComponent
	if shouldDrawLines is true
		g.drawLine goes in here


**drawing constellations of lines between pts
		

*Call super.paintcomponent in paintComponent()
*make sure prevPoint is identified even before setting a value
