*LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 1995 9:09 A.M.*

DEPARTMENT NO. 103 HON. LANCE A. ITO, JUDGE

APPEARANCES: (APPEARANCES AS HERETOFORE NOTED.)

(JANET M. MOXHAM, CSR NO. 4855, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(CHRISTINE M. OLSON, CSR NO. 2378, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

*THE COURT:* BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. MR. SIMPSON IS
AGAIN PRESENT BEFORE THE COURT WITH HIS COUNSEL, MR. UELMEN, MR.
SHAPIRO, MR. COCHRAN, MR. DOUGLAS, MR. BAILEY. THE PEOPLE ARE
REPRESENTED BY MISS CLARK, MR. DARDEN AND MR. HODGMAN. COUNSEL, WE HAVE
A FEW MATTERS TO DISPOSE OF BEFORE WE REACH OUR OPENING STATEMENT STAGE.
COUNSEL, YESTERDAY THE JURORS, WHEN THEY RETIRED, ONE OF THE JURORS
HANDED THE BAILIFFS A NOTE FOR THE COURT AND THEY WERE JUST CURIOUS AS
TO WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT WAS GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO WATCH THE
SUPERBOWL THIS WEEKEND AND I INDICATED TO THEM THAT YES, THEY CAN, AND
THAT WE WOULD ARRANGE THEIR VISITATION SCHEDULE ACCORDINGLY. SO I TAKE
IT THERE IS NO COMMENT ON THAT?

*MR. SHAPIRO:* NO.

*THE COURT:* MRS. ROBERTSON, WOULD YOU CREATE A FILE FOR JUROR NOTES,
PLEASE. ALL RIGHT. FIRST ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED IS THE DEFENSE MOTION TO
ALLOW MR. SIMPSON TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS THE JURY DURING THE COURSE OF
DEFENSE COUNSEL'S OPENING STATEMENTS.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WOULD THE COURT HEAR FROM MR. UELMEN ON THAT?

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY.

*MR. UELMEN:* YOUR HONOR, THE FIRST OBJECTION INTERPOSED BY THE PEOPLE
IS THAT THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE, AND WE HAVE LOCATED AT LEAST
TWO CALIFORNIA PRECEDENTS WHERE IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE. THE FIRST CAME
IN PROBABLY THE FIRST CASE OF THE CENTURY OF THE CENTURY, WHICH WAS THE
TRIAL OF CLARENCE DARROW HERE IN LOS ANGELES FOR JURY BRIBERY. EVEN
THOUGH MR. DARROW WAS REPRESENTED BY EMINENT COUNSEL, EARL ROGERS, HE
WAS ALLOWED TO DIRECTLY PARTICIPATE IN THE PRESENTATION OF THE OPENING
STATEMENT AND CLOSING ARGUMENT TO THE JURY. THE SECOND EXAMPLE CAME IN
1972 IN THE TRIAL OF ANGELA DAVIS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN WHICH,
ALTHOUGH SHE WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, SHE ALSO WAS ALLOWED TO PRESENT
OPENING REMARKS TO THE JURY. SO IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF PROPOSING
SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE AS TO WHICH THERE IS NO
PRECEDENT. THE SECOND OBJECTION RAISED BY THE PEOPLE IS THAT THEY WILL
BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHT OF CROSS-EXAMINATION, AND I THINK THAT REALLY
MISCONCEIVES WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE. FIRST OF ALL, MR. SIMPSON WILL
NOT BE TESTIFYING, AND THE STANDARD INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO THE JURY WITH
RESPECT TO ALL OF COUNSEL'S OPENING STATEMENTS THAT THEY ARE NOT
EVIDENCE AND NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS EVIDENCE BY THE JURY WILL CERTAINLY
APPLY AS WELL TO MR. SIMPSON'S OPENING REMARKS. BUT WHAT IS BEING
PROPOSED REALLY IS NOT A PRESENTATION IN THE TRADITIONAL FORM OF AN
OPENING STATEMENT. WHAT WE ARE SIMPLY PROPOSING IS THAT MR. SIMPSON BE
ALLOWED TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO THE JURORS, TO INTRODUCE THE DEFENSE
TEAM, THE LAWYERS WHO ARE REPRESENTING HIM, AND TO SIMPLY REITERATE HIS
PLEA OF NOT GUILTY. NOW, OF COURSE THE PROSECUTION HAS NO OPPORTUNITY TO
CROSS-EXAMINE A PLEA AND WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE QUITE APPROPRIATE FOR
THE JURY TO HEAR THE PLEA OF NOT GUILTY THAT SETS THIS TRIAL IN MOTION
DIRECTLY FROM THE LIPS OF THE DEFENDANT. THIS IS NOT REALLY ALL THAT
REMARKABLE A REQUEST. WHAT IT REALLY SEEKS TO DO IS TO FOCUS THE
ATTENTION OF THE JURY BACK WHERE IT BELONGS IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THIS
HOOPLA, AND THAT IS ON THE DEFENDANT WHO IS ON TRIAL, TO REMIND THEM
THAT WHAT IS REALLY AT STAKE IN THIS TRIAL IS ONE MAN'S FREEDOM. WE WANT
THEM TO SEE WHO THAT MAN IS. WE WANT THEM TO HEAR FROM HIM VERY BRIEFLY
IN TERMS OF INTRODUCING HIMSELF, INTRODUCING COUNSEL AND REITERATING HIS
PLEA. THE SECOND PART OF THE MOTION SIMPLY ADDRESSES A PHYSICAL
DEMONSTRATION THAT IS ROUTINELY DONE IN TRIALS, ROUTINELY DONE BY THE
PROSECUTION AS WELL AS THE DEFENSE, AND AGAIN WOULD NOT INVOLVE ANY
TESTIMONY, BUT SIMPLY A PREVIEW OF EVIDENCE THAT WILL BE PRESENTED IN
THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. UELMEN, IT WAS REPRESENTED TO ME THAT THAT
PREVIEW WOULD BE MERELY OF THE DEFENDANT'S KNEES REGARDING CERTAIN
SURGERIES THAT HE HAS UNDERGONE AS A RESULT OF HIS ATHLETIC CAREER; IS
THAT CORRECT?

*MR. UELMEN:* YES, THAT IS CORRECT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. AND HAVE YOU CONTEMPLATED THE SECURITY DESIRES
OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, THAT THEY HAVE THEIR BAILIFF IN CLOSE
PROXIMITY TO MR. SIMPSON AT THE TIME THAT THIS IS DONE, AND HOW YOU
WOULD DO THAT IN A MANNER THAT WOULD NOT CONVEY AN UNNECESSARILY
NEGATIVE MESSAGE TO THE JURY?

*MR. UELMEN:* WELL, THAT WAS THE REASON WE BROUGHT THIS UP IN ADVANCE,
YOUR HONOR, SO THAT ADEQUATE PREPARATION COULD BE MADE TO POST A DEPUTY
ON THIS SIDE OF THE COURTROOM, IF THAT IS NECESSARY, BUT IT SIMPLY
INVOLVES HIM WALKING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE COURTROOM TO THE OTHER.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE LOGICAL PLACE TO DO THAT
IS RIGHT BY PROSECUTION COUNSEL THERE.

*MR. UELMEN:* UH-HUH.

*THE COURT:* SO WE HAVE THAT PROXIMITY PROBLEM AS WELL. HAVE YOU
CONTEMPLATED THE LOGISTICS OF OUR UNFORTUNATELY SMALL COURTROOM?

*MR. UELMEN:* WELL, IF THE PROSECUTION WANT TO JUST SWITCH SIDES WITH
US, WE WILL BE GLAD TO MOVE OVER TO THIS SIDE OF THE COURTROOM.

*THE COURT:* YOU ASKED FOR THAT ALREADY.

*MR. UELMEN:* I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT BEING IN
PROXIMITY OF THE DEFENDANT.

*THE COURT:* WELL, I JUST HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AS A SECURITY CONCERN
IS ALL. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR --

*MR. UELMEN:* COULD WE HAVE JUST A MOMENT?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. UELMEN:* I AM UNIFORMED MR. COCHRAN HAS DISCUSSED THE ISSUE WITH
THE BAILIFF AND THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE BAILIFF BEING IN PROXIMITY
WHILE MR. SIMPSON ADDRESSES THE JURY OR DISPLAYS HIS KNEE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. I WILL HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* GOOD MORNING.

*MS. CLARK:* FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS NOT AN OPENING THAT COUNSEL PROPOSES,
IT IS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO CAPITALIZE ON WHATEVER DEFENDANT'S STAR
APPEAL CURRENTLY IS WITH THE JURY AND TO GET HIM TO HAVE CLOSE PROXIMITY
WITH THEM TO IMPRESS THEM. WHAT IS THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF A SCAR? WHAT
DOES IT PROVE TO THIS JURY IN TERMS OF HIS PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES ON THE
NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH, 1994? IT PROVES NOTHING. IN FACT, WE ALL KNOW
THAT THE MORNING OF JUNE THE 12TH HE WAS PLAYING GOLF. WE ALSO KNOW THAT
WITHIN WEEKS BEFORE THE MURDER HE MADE AN EXERCISE VIDEO, SO THE
PROBATIVE VALUE OF THAT SCAR IS NIL AND THE MISLEADING NATURE OF
PRESENTING THAT SCAR TO THE JURY IS GREAT. THE INFERENCE THAT THE
DEFENSE WILL SEEK TO DRAW FROM THAT SCAR IS THAT HE WAS INCAPABLE OF
CERTAIN PHYSICAL ACTS. IF THAT IS WHAT THEY INTEND TO PRESENT, THAT IS
FINE. LET THEM PRESENT TESTIMONY THAT IS CAPABLE OF CROSS-EXAMINATION.
BUT TO HAVE THE DEFENDANT ESSENTIALLY TESTIFY BEFORE THE JURY WITHOUT
TAKING THE WITNESS STAND AND BEING CROSS-EXAMINED IS INAPPROPRIATE. THE
CASES IN WHICH THE DEFENDANTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THE JURY IN
OPENING STATEMENT IN PREVIOUS OCCASIONS HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE THE
DEFENDANT WAS ACTING IN PRO PER. THIS DEFENDANT IS NOT IN PRO PER. HE IS
REPRESENTED BY MANY ATTORNEYS. IF HE DESIRES TO TESTIFY BEFORE THIS
JURY, THEN LET HIM DO SO AS ALL WITNESSES DO ON THE WITNESS STAND AND BE
SUBJECT TO FULL AND COMPLETE CROSS-EXAMINATION. CASE LAW IS COMPLETELY
IN FAVOR OF THE PEOPLE'S POSITION IN THIS REGARD. PEOPLE VERSUS PEREZ,
216 CAL.APP.3D 346, IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT REQUESTED TO BE ALLOWED TO
EXHIBIT HIS TATTOOS WITHOUT BEING SWORN OR GIVING TESTIMONY. THE COURT
REFUSED HIS REQUEST AND RULED THAT THE EXHIBITION OF THE TATTOO WOULD BE
TESTIMONIAL IF OFFERED TO IMPEACH THE TESTIMONY OF AN UNDERCOVER
OFFICER, AND ESSENTIALLY THAT IS WHAT THE INJURIES NOW BEING PROPOSED TO
BE DISPLAYED TO THE JURY IS BEING OFFERED TO SHOW, THAT HE COULD NOT IN
FACT COMMIT CERTAIN ACTS THAT HE IS CHARGED WITH COMMITTING. IT IS
TESTIMONIAL IN NATURE. LET'S MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT. WHAT IS THE
PURPOSE OTHERWISE OF DEMONSTRATING THE SCAR OR OF TALKING ABOUT OR
SHOWING THE JURY WHAT HE CAN AND CANNOT DO? IT IS GOING TO GIVE HIM THE
ABILITY TO LIMP UP TO THE JURY BOX, GET CLOSE TO THE JURY AND TRY AND
IMPRESS THEM WITH HIS PHYSICAL PRESENCE. THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND
THERE IS NO LEGAL BENEFIT TO THIS IN TERMS OF WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IN A
COURT OF LAW. IF THE DEFENDANT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY, THAT IS FINE, BUT
TO DO THIS AND THEN SHIELD HIMSELF FROM CROSS-EXAMINATION, SAY, DON'T
ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS, I JUST WANT TO GET UP THERE AND SHOW YOU
SOMETHING, I WANT YOU TO DRAW INFERENCES FROM THIS, I WANT YOU TO TAKE
EVIDENCE FROM THIS WITHOUT BEING SUBJECT TO CROSS-EXAMINATION, IS
ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE. THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO DO THAT
BECAUSE THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A FOUNDATION LAID. PEOPLE VERSUS PEREZ
MAKES THAT VERY CLEAR. IT INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE IRRELEVANT AS
DEMONSTRATIVE EVIDENCE AS WELL, WHICH IS WHAT THE DEFENSE CLAIMS IT IS
PROPOSING HERE, ALTHOUGH THE PEOPLE DISPUTE THAT AND REALLY IT IS A
TESTIMONIAL IN NATURE KIND OF THING THEY ARE PROPOSING. NEVERTHELESS,
EVEN IF IT DEMONSTRATIVE, THE COURT IN PEREZ RULED THAT BECAUSE THE
DEFENDANT HAD LAID NO FOUNDATION FOR THE ADMISSION OF THE EVIDENCE, IT
WAS APPROPRIATELY DENIED. IN THIS CASE AS WELL WHAT THE DEFENDANT
PROPOSES TO DO REQUIRES EITHER HIS PRESENCE ON THE WITNESS STAND OR SOME
TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESS STAND TO LAY A FOUNDATION FOR ITS ADMISSION.
TO SIMPLY DISPLAY SOMETHING TO THE JURY WITHOUT ANY EVIDENTIARY BASIS
GIVES THEM NOTHING RELIABLE AND NOTHING OF PROBATIVE VALUE. IT IS ONLY A
BLATANT ATTEMPT TO IMPRESS THE JURY WITH HIS CHARISMA AND STAR APPEAL.
THAT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE VEHICLE IN THE OPENING STATEMENT. LET ME
INDICATE ALSO THAT THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS WONG HELD SIMILARLY. IN
PEOPLE VERSUS WONG THE TRIAL COURT INDICATED THAT IT WAS IMPROPER TO
HAVE THE DEFENDANT EXHIBIT HIS ARMS TO THE JURY WITHOUT FIRST BEING
SWORN AS A WITNESS. IN THAT CASE 35 CAL.APP.3D 812, THE DEFENDANT IN
THAT CASE WANTED TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS NOT AN ADDICT, HE HAD NO TRACK
MARKS ON HIS ARMS. THE TRIAL COURT REFUSED TO ALLOW HIM TO DO SO UNLESS
HE SUBJECTED HIMSELF TO CROSS-EXAMINATION. ON APPEAL THE COURT WAS
UPHELD AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IF IT WAS A TESTIMONIAL -- IF IT WAS
BEING OFFERED AS TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE IT WAS PROPERLY REFUSED WHEN THE
DEFENDANT DECLINED TO BE SWORN AS A WITNESS AND SUBJECT HIMSELF TO
CROSS-EXAMINATION. IT ALSO RULED THAT IF THE OFFER WAS A DEMONSTRATIVE
ONE, THEN THE TRIAL COURT WAS JUSTIFIED IN REJECTING IT ON THE BASIS
THAT IT WAS IRRELEVANT. AS I HAVE INDICATED TO THE COURT YESTERDAY, HIS
ARM WAS BEING OFFERED ON MAY 12, 1971, TO SHOW THE CONDITION OF HIS ARM
ON JUNE 5TH, 1970. THE DEFENDANT'S CONDITION TODAY OR THE EXISTENCE OF
THAT SCAR, WITHOUT LAYING A FOUNDATION AS TO WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
THAT SCAR AND HOW IT IMPACTED ON HIS PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES, IS SOMETHING
THAT EXISTS WITHOUT FOUNDATION. IT HAS NO PROBATIVE VALUE IN AND OF
ITSELF. IF THE DEFENSE WANTS TO DO IT AS PART OF AN OPENING STATEMENT,
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ALSO PROFFER SOMETHING THAT LENDS IT SOME
VALUE IN TERMS OF PROBATIVE VALUE. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THEY CAN OFFER
A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE DEFENDANT'S KNEE, BUT SIMPLY HOLDING A PHOTOGRAPH UP
ISN'T GOING TO GET THEM VERY MUCH, SHOULDN'T, BUT THE DEFENDANT -- IN
TERMS OF ITS EVIDENTIARY WEIGHT, BECAUSE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF
HIS PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES OR HIS LIMITATIONS? HAVING THE DEFENDANT AS
WELL GET UP TO TELL THE JURY THAT HE IS NOT GUILTY IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT,
BLATANT ATTEMPT TO HAVE THE DEFENDANT ADDRESS THE JURY WITHOUT BEING
CROSS-EXAMINED. IT IS LIKE ISSUING A BLANKET DENIAL AND THEN SAYING YOU
CAN'T ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS. IN A COURT OF LAW, YOUR HONOR, WHEN A
DEFENDANT SEEKS TO TESTIFY AND AN ISSUES A BLANKET DENIAL, THAT OPENS
THE DOORS TO CROSS-EXAMINATION AS WIDE AS THEY CAN GO AND THE PEOPLE ARE
PERMITTED VERY FAR AND WIDE-RANGING CROSS-EXAMINATION. THE DEFENDANT
SEEKS TO DO THAT IN THIS CASE AND PRECLUDE ALL CROSS-EXAMINATION. HE
SEEKS TO PROTEST HIS INNOCENCE AND YET NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO ASK HIM ANY
QUESTIONS. THAT IS ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE, AND THE COURT I'M SURE IS
VERY WELL AWARE OF THAT. IF HE WAS IN PRO PER, HE COULD GET UP AND SAY
WHATEVER HE WANTED TO; HE IS NOT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WHAT IS YOUR PAGE CITE ON PEOPLE VERSUS WONG?

*MS. CLARK:* 835.

*THE COURT:* WHAT IS YOUR PAGE CITE ON PEREZ?

*MS. CLARK:* 1348 AND GOES ON TO 1349. THE HOLDING -- 1348 AND 9 GIVE
THE FACTUAL EXPOSITION AND 1350 GIVES THE RULING.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MS. CLARK:* ALSO 1352, YOUR HONOR.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER COMMENT?

*MS. CLARK:* NO, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU. MR. UELMEN.

*MR. UELMEN:* THE SUGGESTION THAT A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY SUBJECTS A
DEFENDANT TO CROSS-EXAMINATION IS SIMPLY NOT THE LAW. THE PLEA OF NOT
GUILTY IS WHAT SETS THIS TRIAL IN MOTION AND PUTS THE BURDEN ON THE
PEOPLE OF PROVING GUILT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. IT IS REALLY
INCREDIBLE TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW THE JURORS WILL BE PREJUDICED BY
ACTUALLY HEARING THE PLEA OF NOT GUILTY FROM THE MOUTH OF THE DEFENDANT
HIMSELF. ACTUALLY, THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN ENTER THE PLEA IS THE
DEFENDANT HIMSELF AND THAT PLEA IS WHAT SETS THESE PROCEEDINGS IN
MOTION. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS QUITE APPROPRIATE AND DOES NOT OPEN UP
ANY DOORS TO CROSS-EXAMINATION SIMPLY TO HAVE THE JURY OBSERVE THE
DEFENDANT AND HEAR HIS PLEA OF NOT GUILTY FROM HIS OWN LIPS. THE
SUGGESTION THAT THIS IS SOME SORT OF PLOY TO CAPITALIZE ON THE
DEFENDANT'S CHARISMA OR CELEBRITY STATUS, IT IS JUST THE OPPOSITE. IT IS
JUST THE OPPOSITE. WE DO NOT WANT THIS JURY TO VIEW THE DEFENDANT IN
TERMS OF A CELEBRITY. WE WANT THEM TO VIEW HIM AS A HUMAN BEING, AND
THAT SUGGESTS THE GREATER NEED IN THIS CASE TO DO IT, BECAUSE THERE IS
JUST SO MUCH STAR STRUCK QUALITY ABOUT THIS -- ABOUT THIS WHOLE
PROCEEDING AND WE THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HEALTHY TO REMIND EVERYONE,
ESPECIALLY THE JURY, THAT WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE IS SIMPLY THE LIBERTY OF
A MAN, A HUMAN BEING, AND HERE HE IS, O.J. SIMPSON. IN TERMS OF THE LACK
OF FOUNDATION FOR THE PHYSICAL CAPABILITY OF THE DEFENDANT, THAT WILL BE
PRESENTED IN THE COURSE OF TESTIMONY. OBVIOUSLY THE OPENING STATEMENT
DOESN'T PRESENT ALL OF THE EVIDENCE. IT IS A PREVIEW OF WHAT IS TO COME,
AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO
PREVIEW FOR THE JURY. WHEN IT IS PRESENTED IN THE COURSE OF TRIAL THERE
WILL BE FOUNDATIONAL TESTIMONY FROM MR. SIMPSON'S PHYSICIAN AS TO HIS
PHYSICAL CAPABILITY TO CORROBORATE THE PHYSICAL DEMONSTRATION.

*THE COURT:* WELL, WHEN YOU SAY "DEMONSTRATION," NOW YOU GOT ME SCARED.

*MR. UELMEN:* EXHIBITION.

*THE COURT:* EXHIBITION OR A DEMONSTRATION?

*MR. UELMEN:* EXHIBITION.

*THE COURT:* TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

*MR. UELMEN:* RIGHT.

*THE COURT:* OKAY. THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

*MR. UELMEN:* THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. I HAVE REVIEWED THE CASES CITED BY THE PEOPLE,
AND THE ONLY CASES THAT I COULD FIND THAT WERE OF INTEREST WERE A CASE
OUT OF NEW YORK AND A CASE OUT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSISSIPPI THAT
DEALT SPECIFICALLY WITH THE REQUEST OF A REPRESENTED CLIENT TO ADDRESS
DIRECTLY A JURY. THE MOTION TO ALLOW THE DEFENDANT TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS
THE JURY WILL BE DENIED. THE MOTION TO ALLOW HIM TO EXHIBIT TO THE JURY
HIS KNEE INJURIES OR THE RESULT OF THE SCARRING AND THE SURGERIES WILL
BE ALLOWED. ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, WE NEED TO RESOLVE THEN THE LAST
REMAINING ISSUES ON THE EXHIBITS AND WE WILL BE PREPARED TO GO FORWARD
WITH OPENING STATEMENTS. MR. DOUGLAS.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. GOOD MORNING. YESTERDAY EVENING,
YOUR HONOR, WE WERE ATTEMPTING -- ONE MOMENT, YOUR HONOR.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND
DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. DOUGLAS:* YESTERDAY EVENING, YOUR HONOR, WE WERE DISCUSSING THE
POSSIBILITY OF MAKING ALTERATIONS TO THE SOCK TIMELINE CHART OF WHICH
THERE WAS AN OBJECTION. AS THE COURT WILL SEE, WE HAVE ALTERED THE
OFFENDING LANGUAGE TO REFLECT THE DETAILS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF A REPORT
THAT WAS PART OF AN ANALYZED EVIDENCE REPORT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT
TO THE COURT AND WHICH I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN TO OPPOSING COUNSEL. WHAT IT
SAYS BASICALLY, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT THERE IS A NOTATION REFERRING TO
DIFFERENT PIECES OF EVIDENCE, THERE IS A NOTATION FOR SOCKS, NAVY BLUE
SLASH BLACK.

*THE COURT:* IS THIS THE JUNE 29TH REPORT?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* THIS IS A REPORT, YOUR HONOR -- IF I MAY APPROACH?

*THE COURT:* JUST ANSWER MY QUESTION. IS IT THE JUNE 29TH REPORT?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* YES, IT IS.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* IT TALKS ABOUT THEIR BEING "DRESS SOCKS; BLOOD SEARCH
(NONE OBVIOUS)," AND WE WOULD SUBMIT, YOUR HONOR, THAT THIS IS A FAIR
REFLECTION OF WHAT WE THINK THE EVIDENCE IS GOING TO SHOW. WE WOULD
SUBMIT THAT THAT CHART IS NOT UNDULY PREJUDICIAL AND WE WOULD SUBMIT
THAT THE COURT SHOULD OVERRULE THE OBJECTIONS AND ALLOW THE ADMITTANCE
OF THAT CHART.

*THE COURT:* WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF THAT REPORT?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. DOUGLAS:* THIS REFERS, YOUR HONOR -- THIS DOCUMENT APPARENTLY WAS
PREPARED FOR THE SPLIT HEARING. IT IS PEOPLE'S 2 AT THE SPLIT HEARING,
AND YAMAUCHI, KESTLER AND MATHESON EACH TESTIFIED ABOUT THE PROCESS BY
WHICH THEY TOOK OUT DIFFERENT PIECES OF EVIDENCE AND EXAMINED IT. AND
THIS WAS A DOCUMENT THAT WAS PREPARED SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT HEARING.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THAT DOESN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION. WHO PREPARED --

*MR. DOUGLAS:* WHO PREPARED THE REPORT?

*THE COURT:* WHO PREPARED THAT REPORT?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. DOUGLAS:* MICHELE KESTLER, GREG MATHESON AND COLIN YAMAUCHI.

*THE COURT:* IS THAT THE INDEX PREPARED --

*MR. DOUGLAS:* IT SAYS "SUMMARIZED OF ANALYZED EVIDENCE BY ANALYSIS
PERFORMED." THAT IS THE TITLE.

*THE COURT:* OKAY.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* IT IS EXHIBIT 2 AT THE SPLIT HEARING. THE REMAINING
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR, WOULD BE IN RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE
VIDEOTAPES AND THE SCENES THAT WERE REFLECTED OF DIFFERENT OFFICERS
WALKING THROUGH THE CRIME SCENE AT VARIOUS TIMES. WE HAVE NOW OBTAINED
THE REMAINING TAPE-RECORDINGS, AND YOUR HONOR, THERE WAS A MISSTATEMENT
YESTERDAY. THE SCENES THAT WERE SHOWN IN THE TAPE THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN
OVER TO THE PEOPLE ARE NOT SCENES THAT WERE TAKEN FROM CNN, BUT RATHER
THEY ARE A COLLECTION OF DIFFERENT TAPES THAT WERE RECEIVED FROM
DIFFERENT LOCAL NEWS MEDIA, SO THAT FOR US TO INTRODUCE THESE DIFFERENT
SNIPPETS, IF YOU WILL, AT TRIAL, WE SIMPLY BE ABLE TO LAY THE FOUNDATION
BY SUBPOENAING AND BRINGING IN TO TESTIFY THOSE OPERATORS OF I THINK IT
IS LOCAL CHANNELS, 5, 7, 11 AND 13 FROM WHOM THESE PARTICULAR SNIPPETS
WERE CULLED. THAT TAPE HAS NOW BEEN PROVIDED TO THE COURT AND THAT TAPE
HAS ALSO BEEN PROVIDED TO THE PEOPLE. WE NOW HAVE THE TAPE FROM SAN
FRANCISCO THAT HAD TWO OTHER BLIPS THAT WERE NOT SHOWN ON THE FIRST
TAPE. I AM TOLD BY MR. HODGMAN THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD CONTINUE TO
MAINTAIN THEIR OBJECTION, SO WHAT I WOULD PROPOSE, YOUR HONOR, IS THAT
THE COURT ALLOW THE SHOWING OF THE SCENES THAT WERE DISPLAYED YESTERDAY.
THEY ARE SCENES, YOUR HONOR, THAT ARE VERY CAPABLE OF BEING
AUTHENTICATED. IN MANY WAYS IT IS SELF-AUTHENTICATING. IN MANY WAYS THEY
ARE AUTHENTICATED BECAUSE THERE WILL BE AN EVIDENCE OR A POLICE LOG
WHERE EACH INDIVIDUAL WHO COMES ON TO THE SCENE FIRST CHECKS IN WITH ONE
OF THE POLICE OFFICERS THAT ARE THERE. THAT LOG WILL BE AN ITEM OF
EVIDENCE. AND IT IS POSSIBLE BY SHOWING THE SCENES AND HAVING THOSE
DEPICTED THERE, TESTIFY TO ESTABLISH CLEARLY WHEN THE VARIOUS PIECES OF
SCENES WERE TAKEN AND WHAT SORTS OF THINGS WERE OCCURRING.

IT IS TRUE, YOUR HONOR, THAT IT IS THE PEOPLE'S CRIME SCENE. IT IS TRUE,
YOUR HONOR, THAT THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT HAVE A VIDEOTAPE OF THE CRIME
SCENE. THERE ARE CERTAIN DISCREET ACTS THAT ARE GOING ON, FOR EXAMPLE,
DETECTIVE LANGE MEASURING A CERTAIN LOCATION. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SEE
CRIMINALIST FUNG PLACING DOWN PARTICULAR EVIDENCE TAGS. YOU WILL SEE,
ALTHOUGH YOU WILL SEE DETECTIVES WALKING THROUGH -- DETECTIVE VANNATTER
AND ROGERS WALKING THROUGH, AND QUITE CLEARLY THE SHEET IS THERE BECAUSE
THE BODY HAS BEEN REMOVED, BUT THE SHEET REMAINS, AND IT SHOWS, YOUR
HONOR, THE SORT OF SENSE THAT WE ARE GOING TO DEPICT IN WORDS. IT HELPS
TO PROVIDE A VISUAL CONTEXT TO THE WORDS THAT MR. COCHRAN IS GOING TO
SPEAK. HE IS GOING TO DISCUSS HOW THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THERE WAS
CONTAMINATION OF THE CRIME SCENE. WE WOULD THEN HOPE TO SHOW PICTURES
THAT DEMONSTRATE, THAT REFLECT THE CONTAMINATION OF THE CRIME SCENE.
THEY ARE GOING TO OFFER EVIDENCE, I SUPPOSE, YOUR HONOR, HOW THE CRIME
SCENE WAS NOT CONTAMINATED. PERHAPS THEY WILL SHOW THAT WHEN THESE
SCENES WERE SHOWN ALL OF THE ITEMS OF EVIDENCE HAD BEEN COLLECTED.
PERHAPS THEY WILL SHOW OR THEY WILL OFFER EVIDENCE THAT WHEN THESE
SCENES WERE SHOWN IT WAS THE NEXT DAY OR THE THIRD DAY AFTER.

THAT IS THE RISK THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BY THE STATEMENTS THAT WE ARE
GOING TO MAKE IN OUR OPENING STATEMENT, BUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE THE
VISUAL REFLECTIONS OF CERTAIN WORDS, MR. COCHRAN I THINK QUITE PROPERLY
WILL BE ABLE TO DISCUSS AND TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW THE CRIME SCENE WAS
CONTAMINATED AND HOW WE CONTEND THESE SCENES ARE SIMPLY A SMALL
REFLECTION FROM THE ONLY LIVE RECORD THAT IS AVAILABLE SHOWING THE
CONDUCT OF DETECTIVES VANNATTER AND OTHER DETECTIVES AT BOTH THE
ROCKINGHAM AND BUNDY CRIME SCENES ON JUNE THE 13TH. YOUR HONOR, THAT I
THINK IS THE END OF MY OBJECTIONS TO THE CHARTS THAT THE -- THAT THE
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO OFFER AND MY EXPLANATION TO THE ITEMS THAT WERE
REMAINING YESTERDAY.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU, MR. DOUGLAS. MISS CLARK.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR --

*THE COURT:* I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME. HOLD ON A SECOND.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS CLARK.

*MS. CLARK:* I THOUGHT THAT THE COURT HAD CONCLUDED ITS RULING YESTERDAY
WITH RESPECT TO THE TAPE. MR. COCHRAN MADE A MOTION THAT WHEN A RULING
IS ISSUED WE NOT REARGUE IT AND WE ALL AGREED TO THAT.

*THE COURT:* WHAT I SAID YESTERDAY IS THAT IF THE DEFENSE MAKES THE TAPE
-- VIDEOTAPE AVAILABLE TO YOU AND AFTER REVIEWING THE TAPE YOU STILL
MAINTAIN -- I MEAN, WHO KNOWS, AFTER LOOKING AT IT, YOU MIGHT HAVE
CHANGED YOUR MIND.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT'S TRUE.

*THE COURT:* NOW THAT YOU HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AND IT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT HERE, WHAT IS YOUR POSITION?

*MS. CLARK:* WHAT HE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IT. THEY JUST GAVE IT
TO US THIS MORNING WHEN WE WALKED INTO COURT.

*THE COURT:* HOW LONG ARE THESE VIDEOTAPES, MR. DOUGLAS?

*MR. BLASIER:* YOUR HONOR, THE FIRST TAPE WAS PLAYED I THINK IN ITS
ENTIRETY YESTERDAY. THE SECOND TAPE WE GOT THIS MORNING FROM SAN
FRANCISCO, IT IS APPROXIMATELY 25 TO 30 MINUTES LONG; HOWEVER, A LOT OF
THAT IS A PRESS CONFERENCE BY POLICE OFFICERS. THE FIRST FIVE OR TEN
MINUTES CONTAINS THE THREE CLIPS THAT WE WANT TO USE IN OPENING STATEMENT.

*THE COURT:* THE FIRST FIVE OR TEN MINUTES OF THIS.

*MR. BLASIER:* YES, IN ADDITION TO THE ONES THAT WE SHOWED YESTERDAY.

*MS. CLARK:* THE SAME PROBLEM EXISTS NOW AS IT DID BEFORE. WE DON'T HAVE
A FOUNDATION AS TO TIME AND TIME IS VERY IMPORTANT. THE BLOOD STAINS
WERE COLLECTED AT A CERTAIN POINT AND THAT IS NOT ESTABLISHED WITH THE
TAPE. SECONDLY, THERE IS A COUNTER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TAPE THAT IS
VERY MISLEADING BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ACTUALLY
PIECES OF TAPE WERE ONE CONTINUOUS SHOOT, WHICH IS NOT THE CASE. AS
COUNSEL EVEN CONCEDES, THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE EDITING DONE ON THAT TAPE.
AND THE PEOPLE MAINTAIN THEIR OBJECTION.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. DON'T YOU THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO AT LEAST LOOK
AT THE FIRST FIVE TO TEN MINUTES TO SEE IF YOU STILL DO?

*MS. CLARK:* I WILL BE GLAD TO, YOUR HONOR. LET ME GO ON TO THE OTHER
EXHIBIT. WITH RESPECT TO THE SOCK TIMELINE --

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MS. CLARK:* -- WHAT MR. DOUGLAS HAS REPRESENTED TO THIS COURT IS VERY
MISLEADING. I CONFRONTED HIM THIS MORNING AND I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT
THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS RECORD. I SHOULD INDICATE TO THE COURT, FIRST OF
ALL, IT WAS A CHART PREPARED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE GRIFFIN HEARING TO --
AND THE BLOOD SPLIT HEARING ACTUALLY AT MY REQUEST BECAUSE I WANTED THE
-- TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT THEY PLANNED TO DO WITH ALL THE ITEMS OF EVIDENCE
AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR A SPLIT, WHAT DID NOT, WHAT WAS
CAPABLE OF PCR, WHAT SEEMED TO BE CAPABLE OF RFLP. IN THE BOX MARKED
"COMMENTS" IT SHOWS "BLOOD SEARCH" BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY PLANNED TO
DO. IT HAD NOT YET BEEN DONE. THESE ARE NAVY BLUE TO BLACK SOCKS WHICH
IF YOU LOOK AT IT WITH THE NAKED EYE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE
ANYTHING. IT WAS SCHEDULED FOR A BLOOD SEARCH AND IT WAS PUT DOWN THAT
NONE WAS OBVIOUS BECAUSE ON A BLACK PAIR OF SOCKS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO
SEE BLOOD. AT BEST YOU MIGHT SEE SOMETHING WET, BUT BEFORE A PERIOD OF
TIME, AND WHEN IT DRIES YOU WON'T EVEN SEE THAT, SO IT WAS SCHEDULED FOR
A BLOOD SEARCH. AND WHAT MR. DOUGLAS HAS ON THIS CHART IS VERY
MISLEADING BECAUSE IT INDICATES THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY LOOKED FOR BLOOD
AND THAT NONE IS OBVIOUS. THIS IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM. AND IF MR.
DOUGLAS HAD SPOKEN TO MR. MATHESON HE WOULD TELL THEM WE PUT IT THERE,
AS MANY OF THE OTHER ITEMS LISTED IN THIS "COMMENTS" COLUMN, AS A
PROSPECTIVE PLAN. YOU CAN SEE ON THIS LIST IT SAYS JUST ABOVE IT THE
ITEM NO. 12, "SWATCH, RFLP POSSIBLE" AND ON PREVIOUS ITEMS IT SHOWS
"RFLP WOULD CONSUME, PCR ONLY." IT IS VERY OBVIOUS WHAT THIS IS. THEY
ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS CAPABLE OF BEING DONE AND WHAT THEY PLAN TO
DO, NOT THAT IT HAS BEEN DONE. IT HADN'T BEEN, SO WHAT COUNSEL HAS PUT
THERE IS AGAIN COMPLETELY MISLEADING. IT IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT OCCURRED.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIDEOTAPE AND SEE WHAT
THERE IS.

*MS. CLARK:* MAY I ALSO REQUEST LEAVE OF THE COURT, THERE WAS ONE CHART
WE HAD NOT YET SEEN THAT WE ONLY SAW A XEROX COPY OF. I WANTED TO
ADDRESS THE COURT FURTHER ON IT AND I THINK I CAN DO THAT BETTER IF I
HAVE THE CHART IN FRONT OF ME. THE THAT WAS THE CHART ENTITLED
"DECEPTIONS, DISTORTIONS."

*THE COURT:* I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU HAD NO OBJECTION TO THAT.

*MS. CLARK:* I HAD LOST MY COPY OF IT AT THE TIME, YOUR HONOR. THERE IS
LANGUAGE ON IT THAT I WANTED TO OBJECT TO, NOT THE ENTIRE CHART, BUT
CERTAIN LANGUAGE ON IT AND I NEED TO CONFIRM THAT IT IS ON IT. IF IT IS
NOT, THERE WILL BE NONE, BUT THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH NOT HAVING
EVERYTHING IN COURT ON FRIDAY.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, IS THERE A REASON YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT YOU
DIDN'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOU WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO RULE ON THAT?

*MS. CLARK:* I APOLOGIZE TO THE COURT.

*THE COURT:* I MEAN, I CAN'T KEEP DOING THESE THINGS OVER AND OVER AND
OVER AGAIN.

*MS. CLARK:* I'M ONLY ASKING LEAVE TO SEE THE CHART AS IT CURRENTLY
EXISTS. I HAVE NOT SEEN THE FINAL HARD COPY. ALL WE SAW WAS A RENDERING
ON AN 8-BY-10 PIECE OF PAPER. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE FINAL CHART
SAYS.

*THE COURT:* MR. DOUGLAS, DO WE HAVE THAT AVAILABLE?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* WE ARE LOOKING, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. BLASIER:* I HAVE IT, YOUR HONOR. YOUR HONOR, THE CHART IS BEING
MOUNTED RIGHT NOW AND IT WILL BE PICKED UP THIS MORNING, BUT IT JUST
MIRRORS THIS PARTICULAR CHART.

*MS. CLARK:* DOES THE COURT HAVE A COPY OF THIS?

*THE COURT:* NO.

*MS. CLARK:* DO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA COPY?

*MR. BLASIER:* THAT IS THE ONLY ONE I HAVE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WOULD YOU HAND THAT TO MRS. ROBERTSON, PLEASE.

*MS. CLARK:* I WANT TO ADDRESS THE COURT ON CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS CHART.

*MR. BLASIER:* YOUR HONOR, WE COULD PUT IT UP ON THE --

*MS. CLARK:* THAT WOULD BE GREAT. (BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MS. CLARK:* OURS IS CUT OFF, YOUR HONOR, BUT LET ME FIRST INDICATE WITH
RESPECT TO THE --

*THE COURT:* HOLD ON. I CAN'T SEE THE ENTIRE CHART.

*MS. CLARK:* YOU CAN'T EITHER?

*THE COURT:* NO.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT IS BETTER.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. CAN WE FOCUS THAT A LITTLE?

*MS. CLARK:* WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST ENTRY, "MARK FUHRMAN AND THE
GLOVES," IT INDICATES PLURAL. AT NO TIME DID MARK FUHRMAN SO TESTIFY AND
THE CHART IS MISLEADING WITH RESPECT TO THAT LANGUAGE. THE PEOPLE OBJECT
TO THE USE OF THE PLURAL. THAT NEVER OCCURRED. SECONDLY, "VANNATTER
WARRANT." THE SEARCH WARRANT AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SEARCH ARE
IRRELEVANT TO THE TRIAL BEFORE THE TRIER OF FACT. THAT IS A LEGAL ISSUE
THAT THE COURT RULES UPON THAT IS IMPROPER TO RAISE IN OPENING
STATEMENT, LET ALONE IN TRIAL. I WOULD FURTHER MENTION TO THE COURT, I
THOUGHT THE COURT RULED THAT MARK FUHRMAN COULD NOT BE MENTIONED IN
OPENING STATEMENT.

*THE COURT:* CORRECT.

*MS. CLARK:* THE PEOPLE OBJECT ON THAT BASIS AS WELL.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, MAY I GET A CLARIFICATION, YOUR HONOR, ON THAT?

*MS. CLARK:* FURTHERMORE, THE RON PHILLIPS STATEMENT TO THE CORONER, "WE
ARE KIND OF NOT FOLLOWING PROCEDURE BUT WE ARE KIND OF ASKING A FAVOR,"
A STATEMENT LIFTED OUT OF CONTEXT. THAT IS HEARSAY FROM A TRANSCRIPT
THAT WAS ISSUED BY THE CORONER; NOT A STATEMENT MADE -- NOT A REPORT
MADE BY RON PHILLIPS AND IT IS MISLEADING AND CONFUSING ON THAT BASIS.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS CLARK, BEFORE YOU GET TOO MUCH FURTHER,
COUNSEL, THIS IS AN ARGUMENT. THIS IS NOT AN OPENING STATEMENT EXHIBIT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I RESPOND JUST BRIEFLY?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. COCHRAN:* GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* GOOD MORNING, COUNSEL.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, IN THIS MATTER, IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING
YESTERDAY THAT THE PEOPLE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING. WE
DID SHOW THIS TO THEM AND MISS CLARK INDICATES SHE HAD NO OBJECTION. WE
DON'T WANT TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE. THIS WAS PASSED WE THOUGHT. OUT OF AN
ABUNDANCE OF PRECAUTION, IF THE COURT PLEASES, BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATED
THAT SHE MIGHT CHANGE HER MIND, WE HAVE ANOTHER CHART WHICH I THINK THE
COURT WILL FIND HOPEFULLY LESS ARGUMENTATIVE. I WOULD LIKE FOR THE COURT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WHAT THIS IS BASICALLY IS A SUMMARY OF THE
CONDUCT. AND I WANTED ONE OTHER QUERY OF THE COURT. WITH REGARD TO MR.
FUHRMAN, THE COURT DID NOT SAY WE COULD NOT TALK ABOUT MARK FUHRMAN, I
UNDERSTAND, IN OPENING STATEMENT. WHAT YOU INDICATED WAS THAT WITH
REGARD TO THE KATHLEEN BELL INCIDENT I THINK YOU SAID, BUT YOU NEVER
SAID WE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT MARK FUHRMAN. THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING.

*THE COURT:* THAT'S CORRECT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR. MAY I SHOW THIS TO
MR. HODGMAN AND GIVE YOUR HONOR A COPY OF THIS PROPOSAL?

*THE COURT:* IS THIS A CHANGE TO THIS DOCUMENT?

*MR. COCHRAN:* DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT IT UP THERE FOR YOU?

*THE COURT:* PLEASE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* IT IS UP NOW.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. COCHRAN:* WOULD THE COURT ALLOW ME, WITH REGARD TO THESE ITEMS, THE
COURT WILL RECALL THAT AS PART OF THE EXHIBITS WE WILL HAVE A VIDEO CLIP
OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN. IF MISS CLARK OBJECTS TO THE USE OF THE WORDS
"GLOVES," I WILL STIPULATE TO STRIKE -- MAKE IT "GLOVE," BUT WE STILL
ARE GOING TO MAY THAT CLIP. WITH REGARD TO DETECTIVE PHILLIPS, WE
ACTUALLY HAVE A TRANSCRIPT -- WE PASSED THIS YESTERDAY -- THAT IS
ALREADY COMING IN AND WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING OUT OF CONTEXT. THE
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE EXACTLY THE TRANSCRIPTS. NOTHING IS TAKEN OUT
OF CONTEXT. WITH REGARDS TO DETECTIVE VANNATTER WHERE THE STATEMENT WAS
MADE THAT SIMPSON HAD LEFT ON AN UNEXPECTED FLIGHT TO CHICAGO, WHAT WE
ARE TALKING ABOUT IS NOT RELITIGATING THE ISSUE, IF THE COURT PLEASES,
OF THE ENTRY, BUT TO INDICATE THAT IN THE VERY FIRST CONTACT WITH THE
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AT 10:45 ON 6/12 AN UNTRUTH WAS TOLD. IN THAT
WARRANT UNDER OATH THEY DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH AND WE HAVE THAT AND YOU
SAW YESTERDAY KATO KAELIN'S STATEMENT. YOUR HONOR, WITH REGARD TO
SECURING, DOCUMENTING AND PRESERVING THE CRIME SCENE, EVERYONE HAS BEEN
VERY MUCH AWARE OF THAT, THAT THE TRAINEE MAZZOLLA WAS -- THE THIRD
CRIME SCENE-- WAS BASICALLY THE OFFICER IN CHARGE THERE. WITH REGARD TO
THE BRONCO, WE HAVE LITIGATED THIS AND COUNSEL HAS KNOWN FOR SOME TIME
AND WE HAVE MADE IT IN AS INNOCUOUS LANGUAGE AS WE CAN, THAT THEY FAILED
TO GIVE THAT SPECIAL CARE FOR EVIDENCE PRESENTATION. WE SHOWED ALL THIS
YESTERDAY, YOUR HONOR. WE WENT THROUGH IT. THEY HAD NO OBJECTION. THE
DNA TESTING WE SAID CONSISTENTLY, THEY CAN TALK ALL THEY WANT ABOUT DNA,
BUT ALL THE DNA EVIDENCE PASSED THROUGH THE LAPD BEFORE IT WENT TO ANY
OTHER LAB AND WE THINK IT IS OUR RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE A
CHART THAT WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED ON OF THE -- O.J.'S BLOOD VIAL, THIS
MYSTERIOUS BLOOD VIAL AND ITS SAGA, WHERE IT WENT, INSTEAD OF BEING
BOOKED APPROPRIATELY. AND FINALLY THE QUESTION OF THE SOCKS, WHETHER OR
NOT THERE WAS NONE OBVIOUS ON THE SOCKS. I DISAGREE WITH MY LEARNED
ADVERSARY THAT BLOOD IS RED, ALBEIT DARK RED, IT IS NOT BLACK LIKE
SOCKS, AND YOU WOULD BE ABLE I SUGGEST TO SEE IT. THE QUESTION IS IF THE
PROSECUTION THINKS THAT THEY HAVE A THEORY AND IF WE DON'T AGREE WITH
THAT THEORY THEY THINK THEY ARE ALWAYS RIGHT. THAT IS WHAT A TRIAL IS
ABOUT. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE, JUDGE. THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT. THAT
IS WHY THEY LOSE CASES SOMETIMES. THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT. THE JURY
WILL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. AND THIS IDEA OF PROTECTING THIS JURY,
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO. YOU TOLD US YESTERDAY ABOUT DOING OUR
JOBS AND THAT'S WHEN THE SYSTEM WORKS BEST, YOUR HONOR, AS YOU WELL
KNOW. YOU DO YOUR JOB, WE DO OUR JOB, THEY DO THEIR JOB. WE DON'T NEED
MISS CLARK TO DO THE JOB FOR THE JURY. THEY'LL DO THEIR JOB AND YOU'LL
DO YOUR JOB, AND I PROMISE WE'LL DO OUR JOB, JUDGE, AND THAT IS WHAT YOU
ASKED US TO DO AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. THIS IS A MAN
THAT WE HAVE CONTENDED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IS WRONGFULLY ACCUSED AND
WE -- THEY ARE IN FOR THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIVES, AND SO THIS IS NOT ANY
-- IT IS NOT ANY GAME AND SO WE ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

WE DON'T WANT TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE AND WE WANT TO JUST SPELL OUT -- AND
WE LOOKED AT THIS LAST NIGHT AND EVEN THOUGH SHE PASSED ON THIS, WE
THINK WE SPELLED THIS OUT AND WE THINK IT ADDRESSES ALL OF THE CONCERNS,
YOUR HONOR, AND I THINK THAT CERTAINLY IN OPENING STATEMENT ONE CAN'T BE
PRECLUDED ABOUT WHAT OUR THEORY OF THE CASE IS IN GOOD FAITH. AND SO
WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS MUCH MORE THAN USUAL, JUDGE. THEY ARE HAVING A
TOTAL PREVIEW OF THE THINGS WE EXPECT TO USE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE THE VIDEOTAPE AS WELL.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR, MAY I BE HEARD BRIEFLY?

*THE COURT:* LET ME SEE EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE TO CONSIDER AND THEN I
WILL RULE.

*MS. CLARK:* I HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE NEW CHART, THOUGH, THAT THEY JUST
PUT UP.

*THE COURT:* I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE VIDEOTAPE. THANK YOU. DOES THIS
CONTAIN ANY --

*MR. BLASIER:* YOUR HONOR, THIS PRETTY MUCH STARTS WHERE THE OTHER ONE
LEFT OFF YESTERDAY. THE BODIES HAVE BEEN REMOVED BUT THE CORONER IS
STILL THERE AND MR. FUNG IS PUTTING DOWN HIS TAGS.

(A VIDEOTAPE, WAS PLAYED.) *THE COURT:* MRS. ROBERTSON.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE COURT AND THE CLERK.)

*MR. BLASIER:* YOUR HONOR, I THINK THAT CONTAINS ALL OF THE CLIPS THAT
WE WISH TO SLOW IN OPENING. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE AFTER THIS BUT --

*THE COURT:* STOP THE TAPE.

(THE VIDEOTAPE WAS STOPPED.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS CLARK, I WILL HEAR YOUR OBJECTIONS.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. FIRST OF ALL, WITH RESPECT TO THE
VIDEOTAPE, YOUR HONOR --

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MS. CLARK:* -- AGAIN, THE SAME FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH
RESPECT TO TIME. WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHENTICATION IN TERMS OF THE TIMING
AND THAT IS CRITICAL IN TERMS OF THE EVIDENCE COLLECTION. THE INFERENCE
THAT THE DEFENSE WILL SEEK TO DRAW IS THAT ALL OF THE EVIDENCE COLLECTED
BY LAPD WAS CONTAMINATED IN SOME MANNER BY THE METHOD -- BY THE ACTIONS
THAT ARE SHOWN ON THE TAPE. IF THE EVIDENCE WAS ALREADY COLLECTED BY THE
TIME THESE PEOPLE ARE SHOWN IN THE POSITIONS SHOWN IN THE VIDEO, THEN
THERE IS IN FACT NO IMPACT AND THE INFERENCE THAT THEY ARE SEEKING TO
DRAW IS DIRECTLY MISLEADING TO THE JURY AND THAT IS ONE THING THAT IN
OPENING STATEMENT NEITHER SIDE IS PERMITTED TO DO. THE PEOPLE ARE NOT
ATTEMPTING TO TELL THE DEFENSE HOW TO TRY THEIR CASE. THE PEOPLE ARE
ASKING THIS COURT ONLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JURY IS NOT MISLED SO THAT
THEY GET THE TRUTH, SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EVIDENCE REALLY IS,
NOT SPIN AND NOT DISTORTION AND NOT HALF TRUTHS OR STATEMENTS TAKEN OUT
OF CONTEXT, BUT THE TRUTH. AND THE PROBLEM WITH A VIDEO SUCH AS THIS ONE
IS THAT WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHEN IT WAS SHOT. AND THE INFERENCE
THAT THE DEFENSE SEEKS TO DRAW FROM IT MAY BE COMPLETELY FALSE, IN WHICH
CASE THE JURY BEGINS THE CASE WITH A TOTAL MISCONCEPTION ABOUT THE
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE EVIDENCE WAS COLLECTED. AND THAT IS A VERY
DAMAGING THING AND THAT IS WHY THE DEFENSE OF COURSE SEEKS TO DO IT, I
UNDERSTAND, BUT IT IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO. THE JURY DESERVES
TO GET THE TRUTH AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EVIDENCE REALLY IS.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES, THE
SOCK CHART AND THE CONDUCT CHART?

*MS. CLARK:* YES. I THINK THE SOCK CHART I HAVE, YOUR HONOR. I HAVE
ADDRESSED THAT. THAT IS AGAIN TOTALLY MISLEADING WITH RESPECT TO BLOOD
SEARCH. WITH RESPECT TO THE CHART NOW, THE NEW ONE IS EVEN WORSE THAN
THE OTHER. FIRST OF ALL, IT REPEATS THE MISLEADING AND COMPLETELY FALSE
INFERENCE DRAWN ABOUT THE BLOOD SEARCH. THEY SEEK TO ARGUE IN DEROGATION
OF REALITY, IN DEROGATION OF THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH IS THAT IT WAS
SCHEDULED FOR A BLOOD SEARCH. WHAT THEY SEEK TO INFER FROM THIS IS THAT
IT WAS ALREADY CONDUCTED AND NONE WAS OBVIOUS, AND THAT IS EXACTLY A
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES OPPOSITE OF THE TRUTH, SO THAT IS A COMPLETE
FALSEHOOD. WITH RESPECT TO MARK FUHRMAN AND THE GLOVES, AGAIN IT IS
FALSE. THEY STATE -- THEY PUT ON THE PLURAL WHICH WAS NEVER STATED BY
MARK FUHRMAN. THEY TAKE HIS STATEMENT OUT OF CONTEXT. THERE IS AN
EXTENSIVE COLLOQUY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND COUNSEL IN WHICH HE REFERS TO ONE
GLOVE THAT HE SAW AT THE FOOT OF RON GOLDMAN AND HE SAYS THAT
REPEATEDLY, AND YET TAKING ONE STATEMENT OUT OF CONTEXT THEY SEEK TO
DRAW INFERENCES FROM IT. IT IS ARGUMENTATIVE, IT IS NOT AN OPENING
STATEMENT AND IT IS MISLEADING AND UNFAIR BECAUSE IT IS TAKEN OUT OF
CONTEXT.

THE SAME WOULD GO FOR RON PHILLIPS TO THE CORONER. OF COURSE THESE ARE
TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. HOW COULD COUNSEL ARGUE TO THE CONTRARY WHEN YOU
HAVE A LENGTHY TRANSCRIPT OF STATEMENTS THAT HAVE EXPLANATORY
INFORMATION BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER. YOU HAVE A AND C AND YOU TAKE OUT B
AND THAT IS WHAT COUNSEL HAS DONE, TAKEN IT OUT OF PROPER CONTEXT AND
STUCK IT ON A CHART, AND AGAIN IT IS ARGUMENTATIVE. WITH RESPECT TO THE
VANNATTER WARRANT, THAT STATEMENT IS IRRELEVANT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
LANGUAGE IN A SEARCH WARRANT THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE COURT TO RULE
ON. THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A JURY TO BE PRESENTED. THE JURY HAS TO
BE THE TRIER OF FACT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OR
INNOCENT, NOT WHETHER THE SEARCH WAS PROPER OR IMPROPER. THAT IS A LEGAL
ARGUMENT THAT GOES TO THE COURT; NOT TO THE JURY. THAT STATEMENT IS
INAPPROPRIATE AND IT IS ARGUMENTATIVE AS WELL. WITH RESPECT TO
PRESERVING THE CRIME SCENE EVIDENCE, THE DEFENSE -- IF THEY ARE SAYING
THE TRAINEE IS ANDREA MAZZOLLA, ANDREA MAZZOLLA WAS NOT IN CHARGE. SHE
WAS A TRAINEE WHO WAS BEING SUPERVISED BY DENNIS FUNG, SO THIS IS FALSE.
THIS IS A FALSE STATEMENT. IF THAT IS WHO THEY ARE CLAIMING WAS IN
CHARGE OF THE CRIME SCENE, THAT IS UNTRUE AND MISLEADING. I THOUGHT THAT
THE COURT'S RULING PERTAINING TO MARK FUHRMAN WAS THAT NEITHER SIDE
COULD MENTION HIM. THAT WAS JUST KATHLEEN BELL?

*THE COURT:* THE KATHLEEN BELL IMPEACHMENT ISSUE.

*MS. CLARK:* OKAY. WITH RESPECT TO -- MAY I HAVE A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* WITH RESPECT TO THE ITEMS "FAILED TO GIVE SPECIAL CARE,"
THAT IS MISLEADING AS WELL. THAT IS PUT IN QUOTES AS THOUGH IT COMES
FROM A MANUAL OF SOME KIND, WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT TRUE, AND IT IS
ARGUMENTATIVE. YES, IT IS TRUE ALL EVIDENCE PASSED THROUGH LAPD. NO
OBJECTION TO THAT. WITH RESPECT TO "ALL BLOOD NOT ACCOUNTED FOR," THAT
IS ARGUMENTATIVE. WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT. IF COUNSEL
THINKS THEY CAN LAY A FOUNDATION THROUGH THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL, THAT
IS CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE FOR ARGUMENT, BUT IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR
OPENING STATEMENT AND AGAIN IT IS ARGUMENTATIVE. IS THE COURT --

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU FINISHED WITH YOUR COMMENTS?

*MS. CLARK:* YES, YOUR HONOR, I AM FINISHED. MR. COCHRAN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL. I THINK WE NEED AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER FOR THE
LAWYERS.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE WILL BE PATIENT AT ALL TIMES. YOUR HONOR, IN THIS --
FIRST OF ALL, LET ME AGAIN POINT OUT THIS IS AN OPENING STATEMENT AND
WHEREAS THEY HAVE THEIR THEORIES AND WE HAVE NOT SAID THEY SHOULDN'T
HAVE THEIR THEORIES, WE THINK WE HAVE THE FACTS, BUT CERTAINLY
CONTINGENT UPON THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN INTERPRETATIONS OF WHAT WE THINK
THE EVIDENCE IS, AS THE COURT HAS SO CORRECTLY STATED. WE WERE PERMITTED
TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES PEOPLE SHOULDN'T OBJECT IF THEY HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. AND IN
THIS INSTANCE, YOUR HONOR, I ALREADY CONCEDED WITH REGARD TO USING THE
WORD "GLOVES." I DON'T WANT TO MISLEAD ANYBODY. WE WILL TAKE THE "S"
OFF. WITH REGARD TO DETECTIVE PHILLIPS, YOUR HONOR, WE HAVE THE ENTIRE
TRANSCRIPT THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AVAILABLE. THE COURT HAS RULED WE
CAN USE IT.

WITH REGARD TO DETECTIVE VANNATTER, WE ARE NOT RELITIGATING ANYTHING. AS
I SAID, IT IS ABOUT CREDIBILITY, AND WITH REGARD TO -- AND THIS IS WHERE
COUNSEL, WHO SUPPOSEDLY KNOWS HER CASE, SHOULD REFER TO HER OWN
DOCUMENTS. I WOULD LIKE THE COURT TO SEE THIS REGARDING OFFICER
MAZZOLLA. WE HAVE A FORM 94-0817431 WHICH SAYS "OIC NAME." "OFFICER IN
CHARGE, NAME, A. MAZZOLLA. ASSISTANT NAME, D. FUNG." WE DON'T MAKE THESE
THINGS UP. AND I WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT THAT. IT IS THEIR
FORM. WE DON'T MAKE THESE THINGS UP. WITH REGARD TO "FAIL TO TAKE
SPECIAL CARE," IN QUOTES, THAT IS FROM THE LAPD FORM, YOUR HONOR.
REMEMBER YESTERDAY WHEN WE SHOWED YOU THE FORM, WE PULLED THAT UP WHERE
THEY FAILED TO CHECK THE APPROPRIATE BOX WHEN THE BRONCO WAS LEFT
BASICALLY UNATTENDED FOR ALL THOSE MONTHS. NOW, SHE CAN CONCEDED THE DNA
DID PASS THROUGH LAPD. YES, IT DOES, YOUR HONOR. WITH REGARD TO THE
BLOOD VIAL, THAT IS OUR BELIEF BASED UPON ALL THE DOCUMENTS WE HAVE BEEN
GIVEN IN DISCOVERY, AND IF IT TURNS OUT WRONG, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING
TO SAY. THIS IS BASED UPON THE DOCUMENTS WE HAVE HAD RECEIVED. SHE CAN'T
TELL US WHAT OUR POSITION IS OR WHAT IT SHOULD BE. SHE SHOULD UNDERSTAND
THAT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING. WITH REGARD TO THE SOCKS, WE WILL ACCEPT
WHATEVER YOUR HONOR SAYS ABOUT THAT. AGAIN, IF YOU LOOK AT THIS
PARTICULAR FORM, YOUR HONOR, THIS FORM IS ENTITLED "O.J. SIMPSON SUMMARY
OF ANALYZED EVIDENCE BY ANALYSIS PERFORMED." WE ARE USING THEIR OWN
FORM. THEIR OWN FORM, YOUR HONOR, BY ANALYSIS PERFORMED, AND IT SAYS
UNDER THERE "NONE OBVIOUS" AND SO WE TOOK THEIR OWN FORM. AND SO, YOU
KNOW, THERE WAS A RECENT MOVIE, YOUR HONOR, THERE IS A LINE WHICH I
THINK IS VERY APPROPRIATE IN THIS CASE -- I THINK IT WAS A FEW GOOD MEN
-- WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE TRUTH. I DON'T THINK THEY CAN STAND THE
TRUTH. THAT IS WHAT JACK NICHOLSON SAID. YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH.

AND THAT IS I THINK VERY APPROPRIATE IN THIS SITUATION. THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.

*THE COURT:* WASN'T HE THE BAD GUY?

*MR. COCHRAN:* HUM? THE BAD GUYS SAY SOMETHING WORTHWHILE SOMETIMES,
YOUR HONOR, SO EVEN BAD GUYS -- EVEN BAD GUYS TELL THE TRUTH ON
OCCASION. CERTAINLY WE AREN'T THE BAD GUYS IN THIS CASE, YOUR HONOR.
YOUR HONOR, WITH REGARD TO ONE OTHER THING YOU ASKED US TO DO AT THE END
OF THE DAY AND I BELIEVE THIS IS ON PAGE 25 OF VOLUME 2 -- STRIKE THAT
-- VOLUME 11 OF THE REPORTER'S TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS FROM THURSDAY,
JULY 7, 1994, I WOULD ASK LEAVE OF THE COURT TO READ THIS. IT IS MR.
SHAPIRO QUESTIONING.

"QUESTION: HOW MUCH BLOOD DID YOU WITHDRAW FROM MR. SIMPSON?

"ANSWER: APPROXIMATELY EIGHT CC'S.

"QUESTION: WHEN YOU SAY 'APPROXIMATELY,' DID YOU NOT MEASURE THE AMOUNT?

"ANSWER: WELL, IT COULD HAVE BEEN 7.9 OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN 8.1. I JUST
LOOKED AT THE SYRINGE AND LOOKED AT ABOUT EIGHT CC'S."

YOU ASKED US TO FIND THAT FOR YOU AND I WILL GIVE THIS TO THE CLERK, BUT
ALL WE ARE ASKING TO DO, YOUR HONOR, IS TO STOP ALL OF THIS HAGGLING AND
LET'S START WITH THE OPENING STATEMENTS. AND WE PREVIEWED EVERYTHING AND
I THINK IT IS TIME TO RESOLVE IT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. ALL RIGHT. THE OBJECTION TO
THE USE OF THE VIDEOTAPE IS SUSTAINED. THE ARGUMENT HAS BEEN THAT THE --
THE CONCESSION HAS BEEN THAT THESE ARE SNIPPETS AND THAT THE DEFENSE IS
WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK IN ARGUMENT THAT THEY CANNOT LAY AN ACCURATE
FOUNDATION. THE PROBLEM IS THAT LEADS TO THE DANGER OF MISLEADING THE
JURY, AND I'M NOT WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK DURING THE COURSE OF AN
OPENING STATEMENT, SO THAT OBJECTION IS SUSTAINED. AS TO THE SOCK CHART,
THE LANGUAGE THAT COMES -- THAT IS ON THE SOCK CHART COMES FROM A
SUMMARY OF REPORTS AND TESTING. IT IS NOT THE REPORT ITSELF. THE
OBJECTION IS SUSTAINED AS TO THE LANGUAGE "BLOOD SEARCH NONE OBVIOUS."
IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE SOCK TIMELINE CHART MAY BE USED. AS TO THE
CONDUCT CHART, THE OBJECTION IS SUSTAINED. THESE QUOTES -- SOME OF THESE
QUOTES ARE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT AND THERE IS A DANGER OF MISLEADING THE
JURY AS A RESULT, SO THAT OBJECTION IS SUSTAINED. ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, I
THINK THAT -- OH, I DID NOT RULE YESTERDAY ON THE -- MRS. ROBERTSON
REMINDED ME I DID NOT RULE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE DEFENDANT AND FOUR
LADIES IN FORMAL DRESS.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* MY NOTES SAY THAT THE COURT DID RULE, YOUR HONOR, THAT --

*THE COURT:* I DIDN'T CHECK IT OFF ON MY LIST AND MRS. ROBERTSON
INDICATED I DIDN'T RULE, SO THE OBJECTION ON THAT -- AS TO THAT IS
OVERRULED, SO THE RECORD IS COMPLETE. ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, THAT TAKES
CARE OF THAT. LET ME JUST ADVISE COUNSEL TOMORROW ONE OF OUR SEQUESTERED
JURORS HAS A MEDICAL APPOINTMENT AND WE WILL ADJOURN TOMORROW AT 3:30.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WHAT TIME, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* 3:30, TO ACCOMMODATE THAT. AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TALK TO
COUNSEL AT SOME POINT IN TIME REGARDING YOUR PROPOSAL REGARDING A SCENE
VIEW, WHEN YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY. ALL RIGHT. ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE WE
INVITE THE JURORS TO JOIN US?

*MR. HODGMAN:* YOUR HONOR, MAY WE HAVE A MOMENT?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*THE COURT:* AND THE NEW CHART WILL BE PEOPLE'S NEXT IN ORDER, A
PHOTOCOPY OF THAT, FOR THE RECORD PURPOSES. ALL RIGHT. MR. HODGMAN.

(COURT'S 3 FOR ID = CHART)

*MR. HODGMAN:* THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR. YOUR HONOR, FIRST
OF ALL, THERE IS A MATTER THAT WE WILL NEED TO APPROACH SIDE BAR. I
THINK THE COURT CAN HANDLE IT QUICKLY, BUT IT IS A POINT OF INFORMATION
I THINK ALL OF COUNSEL NEED TO KNOW BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH OPENING
STATEMENTS.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. HODGMAN:* BEFORE WE DO THAT, YOUR HONOR, BEFORE WE DO THAT -- I'M
SORRY, I WAS JUST -- YESTERDAY WE RAISED A DISCOVERY CONCERN WITH REGARD
TO THE DEFENSE. THIS MORNING I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH ANOTHER WITNESS
STATEMENT FROM THE DEFENSE, A MEMORANDUM FROM A MR. WILLIAM PAVELIC
DATED NOVEMBER 2ND, 1994. I HAD ASKED THE COURT YESTERDAY THAT THE COURT
ORDER THAT THE DEFENSE TURN OVER ALL DISCOVERY THAT IS IN THEIR
PIPELINE, SO TO SPEAK, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE SURPRISED ANY MORE.
NOW, I HAVE ASKED MR. DOUGLAS THIS MORNING IS THIS IT? IS THERE ANY
OTHER WITNESS STATEMENT THAT THEY HAVE, REGARDLESS OF AGE, AND I BELIEVE
HIS RESPONSE WAS THAT HE COULD NOT BE DEFINITIVE ABOUT IT. IS THAT
CORRECT, MR. DOUGLAS?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* NO, THAT IS NOT CORRECT.

*MR. HODGMAN:* I WILL LET HIM SPEAK FOR HIMSELF, BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE
THE COURT TO DO IS TO REMIND THE DEFENSE OF THEIR OBLIGATION TO TURN
OVER TO US WITNESS STATEMENTS TIMELY FASHIONED. WE ARE ASKING THAT
EVERYTHING BE DISGORGED, AS I DID YESTERDAY, AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
THAT ORDER MADE CLEAR FOR THE DEFENSE.

*THE COURT:* MR. DOUGLAS.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* YOUR HONOR, YESTERDAY THERE WAS A SPECIFIC REFERENCE MADE
TO AN INTERVIEW OF A SCOTT MATSUDA WHOSE NAME WAS ADDED TO THE WITNESS
LIST AND I SPECIFICALLY HAD ASKED MY INVESTIGATOR FOR THAT PARTICULAR
REPORT AND I ASKED HIM TO CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF THE NAMES
THAT WERE ADDED THAT THERE WERE ANY REPORTS THAT HAD NOT BEEN TURNED
OVER. THAT WAS THE REPORT THAT I WAS GIVEN. THAT WAS THE REPORT THAT I
TURNED OVER AND I WILL AGAIN ENDEAVOR TO REVIEW MY FILES, TO REVIEW THE
FILES OF THE OTHER COUNSEL, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NOT ANY
OTHER REPORTS STILL OUTSTANDING THAT HAVE NOT BEEN TURNED OVER. AND IF I
FIND SO, I WILL GIVE THEM TO MR. HODGMAN.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO REPORT BACK TO THE COURT
TOMORROW MORNING, MR. DOUGLAS, AS TO THAT SEARCH.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. HODGMAN, CAN WE APPROACH NOW?

*MR. HODGMAN:* YES.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU.

(PAGES 11605 THROUGH 11606, VOLUME 74A, TRANSCRIBED AND SEALED UNDER
SEPARATE COVER.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, WE WILL STAND IN RECESS UNTIL 10:30 AND
WE WILL BEGIN OPENING STATEMENTS AT 10:30.

(RECESS.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. MR.
SIMPSON IS AGAIN PRESENT BEFORE THE COURT WITH HIS COUNSEL, MR. SHAPIRO,
MR. UELMEN, MR. COCHRAN, MR. DOUGLAS, MR. BAILEY, PEOPLE REPRESENTED BY
MISS CLARK, MR. DARDEN AND MR. HODGMAN. THE JURY IS NOT PRESENT. DEPUTY
MAGNERA, MAY WE HAVE THE JURY, PLEASE.

*THE BAILIFF:* YES, YOUR HONOR.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, IN THE PRESENCE OF
THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL AND THE AUDIENCE, PLEASE BE SEATED. ALL
RIGHT. GOOD MORNING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

*THE JURY:* GOOD MORNING.

*THE COURT:* WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN WITH THE OPENING STATEMENTS MADE BY
THE LAWYERS IN THE CASE. LET ME REMIND YOU FROM MY INSTRUCTIONS TO YOU
YESTERDAY THAT ANY STATEMENTS MADE TO YOU BY THE ATTORNEYS DURING THE
COURSE OF THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS ARE NOT EVIDENCE AND SHOULD NOT BE
CONSIDERED AS SUCH BY YOU. THESE OPENING STATEMENTS ARE NORMALLY GIVEN
BY THE ATTORNEYS TO SORT OF GIVE YOU AN OVERALL VIEW OF THE EVIDENCE
THAT THEY INTEND TO PRESENT. IT'S TO GIVE YOU A ROAD MAP SO TO SPEAK AS
TO HOW TO EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE. THIS CASE, AS YOU KNOW, WILL BE
RELATIVELY LONG. AND BY NECESSITY, SOME OF THIS EVIDENCE WILL BE
PRESENTED TO YOU OUT OF CHRONOLOGICAL OR LOGICAL ORDER. SO THEY'LL NEED
TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE CASE THAT THEY INTEND TO PRESENT. ALL RIGHT. ARE
BOTH SIDES PREPARED TO GO FORWARD? MR. COCHRAN?

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE ARE, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK?

*MS. CLARK:* YES, WE ARE, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* DO THE PEOPLE WISH TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT?

*MS. CLARK:* YES, WE DO, THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* YOU MAY PROCEED. MR. DARDEN.

*MR. DARDEN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU.

OPENING STATEMENT

BY MR. DARDEN:

YOUR HONOR, JUDGE ITO, MR. COCHRAN AND MR. SHAPIRO AND DEAN UELMEN, TO
MY COLLEAGUES SEATED HERE TODAY IN FRONT OF YOU AND TO THE REAL PARTIES
IN INTEREST IN THIS CASE, THE BROWN FAMILY, THE GOLDMAN FAMILY AND THE
SIMPSON FAMILY AND TO YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, GOOD MORNING.

*THE JURY:* GOOD MORNING.

*MR. DARDEN:* I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT I HAVE THE TOUGHEST JOB IN
TOWN TODAY EXCEPT FOR THE JOB THAT YOU HAVE. YOUR JOB MAY JUST BE A
LITTLE BIT TOUGHER. IT'S YOUR JOB -- LIKE MY JOB, WE BOTH HAVE A CENTRAL
FOCUS, A SINGLE OBJECTIVE, AND THAT OBJECTIVE IS JUSTICE OBVIOUSLY. IT'S
GOING TO BE A LONG TRIAL AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE
YOUR BEING ON THE PANEL. WE APPRECIATE THE PERSONAL SACRIFICES YOU'RE
MAKING BY BEING SEQUESTERED. WE UNDERSTAND THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT. AND I
WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR KEEPING THE PROMISES YOU MADE TO
US WHEN YOU WERE SELECTED FOR THE JURY INITIALLY. YOU PROMISED TO BE
FAIR AND YOU PROMISED TO BE OPEN-MINDED AND YOU PROMISED TO HEAR AND SEE
AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE AND YOU PROMISED TO
FIND THIS CASE -- TO COME TO A VERDICT IN THIS CASE SOLELY ON THE BASIS
OF THE EVIDENCE AND THE LAW GIVEN TO YOU BY JUDGE ITO. AND YOU PROMISED
TO DO THAT BASED ON THE LAW, BASED ON THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE AND
NOTHING ELSE. YOU PROMISED US THAT YOU HAD NO HIDDEN AGENDA, THAT YOU
ONLY WANTED TO SEE JUSTICE DONE AND YOU PROMISED US THAT YOU WOULD DO
EVERYTHING YOU COULD UNDER THE LAW TO SEE THAT JUSTICE WAS DONE. AND SO
I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR THE VERDICT YOU WILL
AT SOME POINT RENDER IN THIS CASE. NOW, WE'RE HERE TODAY OBVIOUSLY TO
RESOLVE AN ISSUE, TO SETTLE A QUESTION, A QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN ON THE
MINDS OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THESE LAST SEVEN MONTHS. IT
CERTAINLY HAS BEEN ON THE MINDS OF MY PEOPLE UP IN RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA
AND FRIENDS IN FAYETTEVILLE, GEORGIA AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW AND EVERYBODY I KNOW OFTEN POSE A QUESTION TO
ME, DID O.J. SIMPSON REALLY KILL NICOLE BROWN AND RONALD GOLDMAN. WELL,
FINALLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM HERE IN FRONT OF YOU THIS MORNING TO
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AND WE'LL ANSWER THAT QUESTION FROM THE WITNESS
STAND AND FROM THE EXHIBITS YOU'LL SEE IN THIS CASE AND FROM THE
EVIDENCE. AND WHEN YOU SEE THE EVIDENCE AND WHEN YOU HEAR THE WITNESSES
AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND CONSIDER THE TOTALITY OF
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE, THE ANSWER WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU AS WELL. THE
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS YES. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE ANSWER TO
THE QUESTION IS YES, O.J. SIMPSON MURDERED NICOLE BROWN AND RONALD
GOLDMAN. AND I'M SURE YOU WILL BE WONDERING WHY AS THE TRIAL PROCEEDS ON
AND I'M SURE YOU ARE WONDERING WHY RIGHT NOW. AS THE JUDGE INSTRUCTED
YOU ALREADY, OPENING STATEMENTS ARE NOT EVIDENCE. OPENING STATEMENTS ARE
GIVEN BY LAWYERS. AND IN AN OPENING STATEMENT, WE INFORM THE JURY OF
WHAT WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IN THIS CASE, WHAT WE BELIEVE THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW. BUT WE'RE LAWYERS. WE'RE NOT WITNESSES. WE'RE NOT
UNDER OATH. NOTHING WE SAY IS EVIDENCE. THE THINGS WE SAY TO YOU TODAY
ARE NOT THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD CARRY INTO THE JURY ROOM AND INTO
DELIBERATIONS. YOU SHOULD CARRY INTO THE JURY ROOM AND INTO YOUR
DELIBERATIONS THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE, THE TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESS
STAND, THE EXHIBITS ADMITTED AT TRIAL, THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO YOU BY
THE COURT. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THAT, WHEN YOU GO BACK AND
REFLECT ON THE TESTIMONY AND THE EXHIBITS AND EVERYTHING YOU HEARD AND
SAW IN THIS CASE, YOU WILL KNOW WHY HE KILLED NICOLE BROWN AND RONALD
GOLDMAN. AND WHEN I GIVE YOU THE ANSWER, AS I HAVE, YOU STOP AND
CONSIDER AND THINK WHY WOULD HE DO IT, WHY WOULD HE DO IT, NOT O.J.
SIMPSON, NOT THE O.J. SIMPSON WE THINK WE KNOW, NOT THE O.J. SIMPSON
WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS. BUT THAT IS ANOTHER QUESTION, AND THAT
QUESTION IS, DO YOU KNOW O.J. SIMPSON. WE'VE SEEN HIM PLAY FOOTBALL FOR
USC. WE WATCHED HIM THRASH UCLA PLAYING THE ROSE BOWL. WE WATCHED HIM
WIN THE HEISMAN TROPHY. HE MAY BE THE BEST RUNNING BACK IN THE HISTORY
OF THE NFL. WE WATCHED HIM LEAP TURNSTILES AND CHAIRS AND RUN TO
AIRPLANES IN THE HERTZ COMMERCIALS AND WE WATCHED HIM WITH A 15-INCH
AFRO IN NAKED GUN 33-1/2 AND WE'VE SEEN HIM TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND WE
CAME TO THINK THAT WE KNOW HIM. WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, IS THE PUBLIC FACE, THE PUBLIC PERSONA, THE FACE OF THE
ATHLETE, THE FACE OF THE ACTOR. IT IS NOT THE ACTOR WHO IS ON TRIAL HERE
TODAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. IT IS NOT THAT PUBLIC FACE. IT IS HIS OTHER
FACE LIKE MANY MEN IN PUBLIC. LIKE MANY PUBLIC MEN, THEY HAVE A PUBLIC
IMAGE, A PUBLIC PERSONA, A PUBLIC SIDE, A PUBLIC LIFE AND THEY ALSO HAVE
A PRIVATE SIDE, A PRIVATE LIFE, A PRIVATE FACE. AND THAT IS THE FACE WE
WILL EXPOSE TO YOU IN THIS TRIAL, THE OTHER SIDE OF O.J. SIMPSON, THE
SIDE YOU NEVER MET BEFORE. WE WILL EXPOSE IN THIS TRIAL AND SHOW TO YOU
IN THIS TRIAL THAT OTHER FACE, THE FACE HE WORE BEHIND THE LOCKS AND THE
GATES AND THE WALL AT ROCKINGHAM, THAT OTHER FACE, THE ONE THAT NICOLE
BROWN ENCOUNTERED ALMOST EVERY DAY OF HER ADULT LIFE, THE ONE SHE
ENCOUNTERED DURING THE LAST MOMENTS OF HER ADULT LIFE; THE SAME FACE
RONALD GOLDMAN ENCOUNTERED DURING THE LAST MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE. WHEN WE
LOOK UPON AND LOOK BEHIND THAT PUBLIC FACE, THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE MAN
WHO SITS HERE IN COURT TODAY, YOU'LL SEE A DIFFERENT FACE. AND THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE FACE YOU WILL SEE AND THE MAN THAT YOU WILL
SEE WILL BE THE FACE OF A BATTERER, A WIFE BEATER, AN ABUSER, A
CONTROLLER. YOU'LL SEE THE FACE OF RON -- OF RON'S AND NICOLE'S
MURDERER. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED AT BUNDY, WE NEED TO EXAMINE THIS
DEFENDANT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH NICOLE. BECAUSE WHEN WE DO, WE CAN DISCERN
FROM THAT, WE CAN SEE A MOTIVE, WE CAN SEE HIS MOTIVE FOR KILLING HIS
EX-WIFE. AND I SUBMIT TO YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT AS THE TRIAL
PROCEEDS ON AND AS YOU HEAR THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, THAT MOTIVE WILL
BECOME CLEAR. HE KILLED NICOLE FOR A SINGLE REASON. NOT BECAUSE HE HATED
HER. HE DIDN'T HATE NICOLE. HE DIDN'T KILL HER BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LOVE
HER ANYMORE, BECAUSE IN HIS MIND, IN HIS MIND, HE DID. HE KILLED HER FOR
A REASON ALMOST AS OLD AS MANKIND ITSELF. HE KILLED HER OUT OF JEALOUSY.
HE KILLED HER BECAUSE HE COULDN'T HAVE HER; AND IF HE COULDN'T HAVE HER,
HE DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE TO HAVE HER. HE KILLED HER TO CONTROL HER.
CONTROL IS A CONTINUING THING. IT WAS A CONTINUING THING, THE CENTRAL
FOCUS OF THEIR ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP. BY KILLING NICOLE, THIS DEFENDANT
ASSUMED TOTAL CONTROL OVER HER. BY KILLING HER, HE COMMITTED THE
ULTIMATE ACT OF CONTROL. BY KILLING HER, NO ONE ELSE COULD HAVE HER, NO
ONE BUT HIM. AND HE KILLED RON GOLDMAN. AND HE KILLED RON GOLDMAN FOR
ANOTHER REASON. HE KILLED RON GOLDMAN BECAUSE HE GOT IN THE WAY. HE
KILLED NICOLE BECAUSE HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH HER AS MEN AND WOMEN
SOMETIMES DO HAVE IN A RELATIONSHIP. THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. AND THIS
DEFENDANT'S PROBLEM, THE MAN IN THE COURTROOM -- I THINK HE STATED HIS
PROBLEM RATHER ELOQUENTLY AT HER WAKE AS HE STOOD OVER HER BODY AT HER
WAKE, AND HE SAID THEN AND HE SAID ON OTHER OCCASIONS, AND I QUOTE, HE
SAID WHILE STANDING OVER THAT CASKET, WHILE STANDING OVER NICOLE'S BODY,
"MY PROBLEM WAS THAT I LOVED YOU TOO MUCH." BUT IT WASN'T REALLY LOVE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND THIS WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE EVIDENCE AND THE
EVIDENCE WILL ESTABLISH THIS, THAT IT WASN'T REALLY LOVE. WHAT THIS
DEFENDANT HAD FOR NICOLE BROWN WASN'T LOVE. IT WAS OBSESSION. HE BECAME
OBSESSED WITH HER, AND HIS OBSESSION WAS SO GREAT THAT HE DEVELOPED A
NEED TO CONTROL HER. AND HIS NEED TO CONTROL AND HIS FEELINGS OF
OBSESSION AND HIS OBSESSION WAS SO GREAT THAT WHEN HE CAME TO REALIZE
THAT HE COULD NOT KEEP HER, HE KILLED HER BECAUSE TO LET HER GO WOULD
MEAN TO LOSE CONTROL OF HER. TO LET HER GO WITH RON GOLDMAN OR SOMEONE
ELSE WOULD MEAN TO LOSE CONTROL. HE COULDN'T HAVE HER AND NEITHER COULD
ANYONE ELSE. NOW, THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE WILL ESTABLISH THAT THE MAN
IN THE COURTROOM, THIS DEFENDANT IS AN EXTREMELY CONTROLLING AND
POSSESSIVE MAN. AND AS I SAID BEFORE, CONTROL AND POSSESSIVENESS WAS A
SINGLE DOMINANT THING THROUGHOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP. AND HE CONTROLLED
HER IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. HE CONTROLLED HER FINANCIALLY. AND WHEN THE
DEFENDANT AND NICOLE FIRST MET, SHE WAS BARELY 18 YEARS OLD. HE WAS
ALMOST 30. SHE SHARED AN APARTMENT. HE OWNED A MANSION. SHE WAITED
TABLES AT A RESTAURANT. HE WAS A MILLIONAIRE. NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF
NICOLE BROWN, BUT HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZED MEN IN AMERICA. BUT
AFTER HE MET HER, HE SLOWLY BEGAN TO CONTROL HER. SHE SHARED AN
APARTMENT WITH A FRIEND. HE GOT HER HER OWN APARTMENT. HE BOUGHT HER
THINGS. HE GAVE HER THINGS. BY THE TIME SHE WAS 19, SHE WAS DRIVING A
PORSCHE. HE GOT IT FOR HER. HE BEGAN TO GAIN CONTROL OVER HER. AND
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, THROUGHOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP, HE MAINTAINED THAT
ECONOMIC CONTROL OVER HER, THAT FINANCIAL CONTROL. THE EVIDENCE WILL
SHOW THAT NICOLE NEVER REALLY HELD A JOB. SHE NEVER REALLY WORKED. SHE
NEVER REALLY OPERATED A BUSINESS. SHE NEVER HAD AN INCOME REALLY OF HER
OWN. THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE ADULT LIFE, THIS MAN, DEFENDANT IN THE
COURTROOM, HELD HER PURSE STRINGS IN HER LIFE. WHATEVER MONEY SHE GOT,
WHATEVER MATERIAL POSSESSIONS SHE GOT, SHE GOT FROM THE DEFENDANT.
PEOPLE CAN SOMETIMES BE BOUGHT. AND YOUNG PEOPLE SOMETIMES CAN BE EASILY
MISLED. NICOLE WAS A VERY YOUNG WOMAN IF A WOMAN AT ALL WHEN SHE FIRST
MET THIS DEFENDANT, THE MAN SEATED IN THE COURTROOM. AND AS THE YEARS
WENT ON AND AS THEY CONTINUED TO DATE AND AS HE GAINED MORE AND MORE
CONTROL OVER HER, THE MORE CONTROL HE GAINED, THE MORE ABUSIVE HE
BECAME. AS YOU LISTEN TO THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE
HEARING EVIDENCE REGARDING DOMESTIC ABUSE, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, STALKING,
INTIMIDATION, PHYSICAL ABUSE, WIFE BEATING, PUBLIC HUMILIATION. AS YOU
LISTEN TO THE TRIAL AND AS YOU HEAR THIS EVIDENCE AND SEE THIS EVIDENCE,
PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ABUSE WERE ALL
DIFFERENT METHODS TO CONTROL HER. LET ME PROCEED ON. THE EVIDENCE WILL
SHOW IN THIS CASE THAT HE ABUSED HER MENTALLY. HE STRIPPED HER OF HER
SELF ESTEEM. THIS DEFENDANT DICTATED THE WAY NICOLE WOULD DRESS. HE
DICTATED THE WAY SHE WOULD WEAR HER HAIR. AND WHEN HE DIDN'T LIKE HER
APPEARANCE, HE WOULD CRITICIZE HER, HE WOULD HUMILIATE HER TO THE POINT
WHERE SHE WOULD CRY. IF HE DIDN'T LIKE HER SHOES, HE WOULD GO OUT AND
BUY SHOES. "THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO WEAR. WEAR THIS. LOOK LIKE THIS."
SHE WAS NOT A BARBIE DOLL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW
THAT HE WAS SO CONTROLLING THAT HE ATTEMPTED TO DEFINE HER IDENTITY. HE
ATTEMPTED TO DEFINE WHO SHE WAS. WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT AND PUT ON
WEIGHT, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS DEFENDANT WAS SO ABUSIVE THAT
HE CALLED HER NAMES. HE CALLED HER FAT. HE CALLED HER A PIG. AND HE DID
THIS IN THE PRESENCE OF HER FAMILY AND IN THE PRESENCE OF HER FRIENDS
AND HE HUMILIATED HER. THAT IS THE FACE WE INTEND TO EXPOSE IN THIS
TRIAL. THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DEFENDANT WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU
IN THIS TRIAL. AND BY DOING THESE THINGS AND BY HURTLING THESE INSULTS,
HE STRIPPED HER OF HER SELF ESTEEM. AND WHEN YOU'RE CONTROLLING SOMEONE
FINANCIALLY AND WHEN THEY HAVE NO SELF ESTEEM AND WHEN THEY HAVE NO
IDENTITY, YOU HAVE THEM, YOU CONTROL THEM. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT
THIS DEFENDANT, THIS MAN IN THE COURTROOM WAS A VERY CONTROLLING AND
POSSESSIVE MAN AND THAT THE DOMINANT THING THROUGHOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP
WAS HIS CONTROL OF NICOLE BROWN. BUT HE DID MORE. HE DID MORE THAN JUST
DEMEAN HER IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS. HE ATTEMPTED TO ISOLATE HER
SOMETIMES FROM SOME PEOPLE. WHEN CERTAIN MEN CAME AROUND, HE BECAME
JEALOUS AND HE BECAME SO JEALOUS THAT HE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE SHE
WOULD NOT AGREE OR WANT TO BE AROUND CERTAIN MEN BECAUSE SHE WAS
CONCERNED THAT HE MIGHT GET JEALOUS BY THEIR MERE PRESENCE. AND AS TIME
WENT ON AND AS HE BECAME JEALOUS AND MORE AND MORE JEALOUS, HE EVEN
INSISTED THAT SHE NOT BE AROUND CERTAIN MEN. HE BEGAN TO ISOLATE HER,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHEN HER FRIENDS CAME AROUND, HER GIRLFRIENDS CAME
AROUND AND WHEN HE FELT THAT SHE WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH THOSE
GIRLFRIENDS, HE TALKED TO THE GIRLFRIENDS. HE LET THEM KNOW. HE DIDN'T
LIKE THEM HANGING AROUND. HE DISSUADED HER GIRLFRIENDS FROM HANGING
AROUND. HE ATTEMPTED TO ISOLATE HER FROM OTHER PEOPLE. AND WHEN YOU
ISOLATE SOMEONE AND WHEN YOU HAVE ECONOMIC CONTROL OVER SOMEONE AND WHEN
YOU STRIP SOMEONE OF THEIR SELF ESTEEM AND WHEN YOU ESTABLISH THEIR
IDENTITY, YOU HAVE THEM. THEY'RE YOURS. YOU CAN CONTROL THEM. AND THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IN THIS CASE THAT THIS MAN IS AN EXTREMELY POSSESSIVE
AND CONTROLLING INDIVIDUAL AND THAT HE IS AN EXTREMELY POSSESSIVE
INDIVIDUAL WHEN IT CAME TO NICOLE, AND HIS OBSESSION WAS MANIFESTED BY
THE THINGS HE DID TOWARD CONTROLLING HER. BY DEMEANING HER AND
CONTROLLING THE PURSE STRINGS AND ISOLATING HER AND DEFINING WHO SHE
WOULD SEE AND WHO SHE WOULDN'T SEE AND WHO HER FRIENDS WOULD BE AND WHO
THEY WOULD NOT BE WASN'T ALL THIS DEFENDANT DID TO CONTROL THIS WOMAN.
THERE ARE MORE POWERFUL FORMS OF CONTROL. THERE'S FORCE, THERE'S
VIOLENCE, THERE'S FEAR, THERE'S INTIMIDATION. AND YOU WILL HEAR
TESTIMONY, YOU WILL SEE EVIDENCE THAT IN HIS QUEST TO CONTROL NICOLE,
THIS DEFENDANT USED ALL THESE THINGS. HE USED FEAR, HE USED INTIMIDATION
AND HE USED VIOLENCE. AND HE INSTILLED SUCH A FEAR IN HER, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, YOU'LL HEAR TESTIMONY THAT HE COULD WALK INTO A ROOM -- HE
WOULD WALK INTO A ROOM, AND NICOLE WOULD BE THERE, AND A MOMENT BEFORE
HE WALKED IN, SHE WOULD JUST BE THE MOST CHARMING INDIVIDUAL THAT THERE
IS, RELAXED; BUT WHEN HE WALKED IN, HER DEMEANOR CHANGED COMPLETELY. AS
TIME WENT ON, HIS MERE PRESENCE BECAME INTIMIDATING TO HER. I MENTIONED
EARLIER THAT THEY MET WHEN SHE WAS AROUND 18 YEARS OLD BACK IN 1977, AND
THEY DATED FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THEY EVENTUALLY MARRIED IN 1985. AND THE
MARRIAGE WAS A STORMY MARRIAGE AND IT WAS A MARRIAGE PUNCTUATED BY ACTS
OF VIOLENCE. AND THAT VIOLENCE WOULD ALWAYS BE FOLLOWED BY AN APOLOGY.
HE WOULD APOLOGIZE, GIVE HER JEWELRY, BUY HER FLOWERS. HE WOULD PROMISE
TO DO BETTER, PROMISE, PROMISE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF HIMSELF AND HE
WOULD PROMISE NOT TO DO IT AGAIN. AND THEN THOSE ACTS OF VIOLENCE WOULD
BE FOLLOWED BY ADDITIONAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE, AND IT BECAME A CYCLE;
VIOLENCE, APOLOGIES, A PERIOD OF QUIET AND CALM, THEN VIOLENCE AND
APOLOGIES, QUIET AND CALM, VIOLENCE, APOLOGIES, QUIET, CALM. A CYCLE OF
VIOLENCE CHARACTERIZED THEIR RELATIONSHIP. IT CHARACTERIZED THEIR
MARRIAGE. AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT'S -- THAT'S
A DIFFICULT TOPIC BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS
BEHIND THE GATES AND THE WALLS. IT HAPPENS IN THE BEDROOM AND INSIDE THE
HOME AND PLACES WHERE THE PUBLIC CAN'T SEE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A
PRIVATE AFFAIR GENERALLY WHILE IT'S OCCURRING, AND SO IT MAKES IT
DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN EVIDENCE, TO GAIN PROOF THAT THE VIOLENCE OCCURRED
AND IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN EVIDENCE AND GAIN PROOF THAT THE
RELATIONSHIP IS A VIOLENT RELATIONSHIP. BUT WE DO HAVE THAT PROOF. WE DO
HAVE PROOF. WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE. YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY FROM WITNESSES
IN THIS CASE, AND THEY WILL DISCUSS THE VIOLENT RELATIONSHIP, THE
VIOLENT MARRIAGE THIS DEFENDANT HAD WITH NICOLE BROWN. IN 1985, THE
POLICE RESPONDED TO THE DEFENDANT'S HOME ON ROCKINGHAM IN RESPONSE TO A
CALL. AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED, THEY WERE MET BY NICOLE. SHE WAS CRYING,
SHE WAS UPSET AND HER FACE WAS PUFFY AND SHE WAS NEAR HYSTERICS. SHE
TOLD THESE PEOPLE, SHE SAID, "WE HAD A FIGHT. AFTER THE FIGHT, I WAS
TRYING TO LEAVE. AND WHEN I TRIED TO LEAVE, THE DEFENDANT GRABBED A
BASEBALL BAT, AND HE TOOK THAT BASEBALL BAT AND HE SMASHED THE
WINDSHIELD TO MY CAR." THIS IS 1985. AND AS THEY LOOKED AROUND, THESE
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, THEY LOOKED TO THE RIGHT AND THEY SAW A WHITE
450SL MERCEDES BENZ, AND THE WINDSHIELD WAS SMASHED OUT. JUST THEN, THE
DEFENDANT CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND HE OFFERED AN EXPLANATION. WELL, THE
POLICE DIDN'T ARREST HIM. THEY LEFT. THEY LEFT NICOLE THERE. THEY LEFT
THE DEFENDANT THERE. AND THAT ISN'T AN ACT OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TOWARD
NICOLE, IS IT, OR IS IT? MAYBE IT IS. NICOLE BROWN WAS THERE TO WITNESS
THIS ACT, THIS VIOLENCE ON HER VEHICLE. AND IF YOU'RE MARRIED TO SOMEONE
AND YOU LOVE SOMEONE AND YOU HAVE A FIGHT WITH THEM AND THEY TAKE A
BASEBALL BAT AND THEY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO ONE OF YOUR PRIZED
POSSESSIONS, COULD IT BE, COULD IT BE THAT THEY ARE SENDING A MESSAGE?
THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS WAS A MESSAGE. IT WAS AN INDICATION, IT
WAS A WARNING AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT. IT WAS A WARNING THAT WHAT
HAPPENED TO THIS MERCEDES BENZ COULD JUST AS WELL HAPPEN TO YOU. AND IT
DID HAPPEN TO NICOLE. NOT WITH THE BASEBALL BAT; BUT JUST LIKE THAT
MERCEDES GOT SMASHED AND DENTED, SO DID NICOLE. YOU WILL BE HEARING
EVIDENCE, YOU WILL BE HEARING TESTIMONY, YOU WILL BE SEEING WITNESSES IN
THIS CASE REGARDING AN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 1, 1989. IT WAS
ALMOST 4:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ON JANUARY 1ST WHEN THE 911 OPERATOR
RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM ROCKINGHAM. AND THAT OPERATOR WILL BE
HERE TO TESTIFY IN COURT AND THAT OPERATOR WILL BE HERE TO AUTHENTICATE
THE TAPE OF THAT 911 CALL FROM ROCKINGHAM. AND WHEN THE OPERATOR APPEARS
AND WHEN THE TAPE IS PLAYED, LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY, BECAUSE IF YOU
LISTEN CAREFULLY, IN THE BACKGROUND, YOU WILL HEAR A WOMAN SCREAMING AND
YOU WILL HEAR SOMETHING ELSE. YOU WILL HEAR THE SOUND OF THIS DEFENDANT,
THIS MAN BEATING THIS WOMAN. YOU WILL HEAR THE SOUND OF HIS HAND
SMACKING ACROSS HER FACE. YOU WILL HEAR THE SOUND OF THIS DEFENDANT
BEATING HIS WIFE. WHEN THE POLICE ARRIVED, THEY ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM IN
RESPONSE TO THAT TELEPHONE CALL. AND NICOLE NEVER GOT TO TELL THE 911
OPERATOR THAT, "COME AND HELP ME," OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ALL SHE DID
WAS SCREAM. AND THE OPERATOR COULD HEAR HER SCREAMING AND THE OPERATOR
COULD HEAR HER BEING BEATEN, AND SHE ADVISED LAPD UNITS TO RESPOND TO
360 NORTH ROCKINGHAM. "WE CAN HEAR THE SOUND OF A WOMAN BEING BEATEN
NOW, RIGHT NOW." AND THE OFFICERS ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM A SHORT TIME
LATER. AND WHEN THEY DID, THEY RANG THE BUZZER TO THE SECURITY GATE. AND
AS THEY DID SO, THEY SAW SOMEONE RUN FROM THE BUSHES, RUN FROM THE
DARKNESS IN THEIR DIRECTION. AND THE PERSON THAT THEY SAW WAS NICOLE.
AND NICOLE CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE DARKNESS WEARING NOTHING BUT SWEAT
PANTS AND A BRA RUNNING TOWARDS THE OFFICERS, AND SHE WAS COVERED WITH
MUD AND SHE WAS DIRTY, SHE WAS FILTHY. AND SHE RAN TOWARDS THE OFFICERS.
AND AS SHE RAN TOWARDS THE OFFICERS, SHE WAS SHOUTING AND YELLING, "HE'S
GOING TO KILL ME. HE'S GOING TO KILL ME." AND THE OFFICERS STOOD THERE.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. IT'S 4:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. SHE IS
OUT THERE IN HER BRA AND SWEAT PANTS COVERED WITH MUD. THEY JUST GOT A
CALL, THERE'S A WOMAN AT ROCKINGHAM BEING BEATEN NOW. SHE COMES RUNNING
OUT OF THE DARKNESS OUT OF THE MUD AND OUT OF THE BUSHES, AND SHE PUSHES
A BUTTON TO THE SECURITY GATE AND SHE RUNS THROUGH THE GATE AND SHE
COLLAPSES IN THE ARMS OF THE OFFICER. THE ENTIRE TIME, SHE IS YELLING,
"HE'S GOING TO KILL ME. HE'S GOING TO KILL ME." AND THE OFFICER SAID,
"WHO'S GOING TO KILL YOU?" SHE SAID, "O.J. IS GOING TO KILL ME." AND THE
OFFICERS LOOKED, THEY LOOKED AT NICOLE. HER EYE WAS SWOLLEN, BRUISED,
HER LIP WAS CUT. ONE OF THE OFFICERS, THE SENIOR OFFICER THERE, HE
LOOKED AT HER NECK; AND WHAT HE SAW STARTLED HIM. ON HER NECK, HE COULD
SEE THE IMPRINT OF A HAND, THE IMPRINT OF A HAND AROUND HER NECK. IT WAS
THEN THAT THE DEFENDANT CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE. HE WAS WEARING NOTHING
BUT HIS BATHROBE. AND HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIS WIFE AT THE TIME AND HE DID
NOT ASK THE POLICE HOW SHE WAS DOING OR IF SHE WAS OKAY. AND WHAT THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW AND WHAT YOU WILL HEAR IN THIS CASE IS THAT HE
DEMEANED AND HUMILIATED HER EVEN MORE. HE SHOUTED TO THE OFFICERS IN THE
PRESENCE OF NICOLE, HIS WIFE, "I'VE GOT TWO WOMEN NOW. I DON'T NEED THAT
ONE. I DON'T WANT THAT ONE IN MY BED ANYMORE." THIS WAS HIS WIFE, AND
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TO THESE OFFICERS, THESE STRANGERS TO HIM. THIS IS
WHAT HE SHOUTED OUT TO THE POLICE. THE OFFICERS WERE ON ONE SIDE OF THE
GATE, OF THE WALL AND THE DEFENDANT AT THAT TIME WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
AND THE OFFICERS SAID, "MR. SIMPSON, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PLACE YOU
UNDER ARREST. IT APPEARS THAT YOUR WIFE HAS BEEN BEATEN. SO PLEASE GO
BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND PUT ON SOME CLOTHES AND COME WITH US. WE'RE
GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE STATION." WELL, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT
THAT DID NOT SIT WELL WITH THIS DEFENDANT, AND HE RESPONDED, "THE POLICE
HAVE BEEN HERE EIGHT TIMES BEFORE, AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO ARREST ME FOR
THIS?" EIGHT TIMES. THAT'S WHAT THE DEFENDANT SAID. THE POLICE HAD BEEN
THERE EIGHT TIMES BEFORE? AND AS HE SAID, "YOU'RE GOING TO ARREST ME FOR
THIS," THE DEFENDANT TOLD THE OFFICERS, "THIS IS A FAMILY MATTER."
THAT'S WHAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW. THE DEFENDANT SAID TO THE OFFICERS,
"THIS IS A FAMILY MATTER." AND HE ASKED, "WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE SUCH A
BIG DEAL OUT OF IT? WE CAN HANDLE IT." THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE
OFFICERS DID NOT LIKE THE WAY HE HAD HANDLED THINGS UP TO THAT POINT,
AND THEY INSISTED THAT HE GET DRESSED AND THEY TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS
UNDER ARREST AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE HIM TO THE STATION. WELL,
THIS WAS O.J. SIMPSON. AND HE DID GET DRESSED, BUT HE DIDN'T GO TO THE
POLICE STATION. HE JUMPED IN HIS BENTLEY, HE SPED AWAY, THEY CHASED
AFTER HIM, THEY DIDN'T CATCH HIM AND HE GOT AWAY. THE NEXT DAY, HE WENT
TO THE ROSE BOWL. BUT DESPITE THIS, DESPITE '89, WHAT HAPPENED JANUARY
1, '89, DESPITE THE MERCEDES BENZ INCIDENT IN 1985, SHE STAYED. SHE
STAYED WITH HIM. AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING AND THE EVIDENCE WON'T SUGGEST
THAT EVERY DAY OF THEIR MARRIAGE OR THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS STORMY, ROCKY
AND FILLED WITH VIOLENCE. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING HERE. WHAT WE
ARE SUGGESTING, AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, THAT THERE WAS A CYCLE OF
VIOLENCE, A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE; AND THE DOMINANT THEME IN THAT
RELATIONSHIP AND IN THAT CYCLE AND THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE WAS ALWAYS
CONTROL, CONTROL. WELL, AFTER THE '89 INCIDENT, AFTER THAT NIGHT, THEIR
RELATIONSHIP CHANGED SOMEWHAT. SHE WAS CONCERNED AND THE DEFENDANT WAS
CONCERNED. THE DEFENDANT IS A PUBLIC MAN, AND HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HIS
PUBLIC IMAGE. AND IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND IN THE PUBLIC MEDIA BACK IN
1989, HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY ROY FIRESTONE ON ESPN. AND DURING THAT
INTERVIEW, MR. FIRESTONE ASKED THE DEFENDANT ABOUT THAT INCIDENT ON THE
MORNING OF JANUARY 1, AND THE DEFENDANT DOWNPLAYED IT. HE MINIMIZED
THINGS, FLUFFED IT OVER. AND YOU'LL HEAR AND SEE THAT INTERVIEW. AND IN
THAT INTERVIEW, THE DEFENDANT SAID IT WAS SORT OF A MUTUAL WRESTLING
MATCH, SHE WAS WRONG, HE WAS WRONG, TA DA, NO BIG DEAL, AND THAT'S WHAT
HE SAID TO THE PRESS AND TO THE PUBLIC. HE MINIMIZED THINGS. BUT YOU'LL
HEAR TESTIMONY FROM INVESTIGATORS EMPLOYED WITH THE D.A.'S OFFICE AND
THEY'LL TELL YOU ABOUT A DAY JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN THEY DRILLED A
HOLE IN THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX, NICOLE'S SAFE DEPOSIT BOX, AND THEY'LL
TELL YOU ABOUT THE DAY THAT THEY RECOVERED PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN FROM
NICOLE'S INCIDENT BACK IN '89 AND THEY'LL ALSO TELL YOU ABOUT THE
RECOVERY OF SOME LETTERS THE DEFENDANT WROTE TO NICOLE AFTER THE 1989
BEATING. AND YOU'LL SEE THOSE LETTERS. THEY'LL BE HERE. YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO READ THEM. AND YOU'LL NOTE THAT THE ACCOUNT THE DEFENDANT GAVE THE
PRESS AND THE MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC WAS NOT THE SAME ACCOUNT HE GAVE
NICOLE IN THOSE LETTERS DURING THAT APOLOGY PHASE, THE APOLOGY PHASE,
THE CONTRITION PHASE, THE PHASE HE WAS GOING THROUGH. IN THE LETTER HE
WROTE TO NICOLE, HE APOLOGIZED FOR HURTING HER. IN THE LETTER HE WROTE
TO NICOLE, HE ADMITTED HE HAD LOST CONTROL. AND IN THE LETTER TO NICOLE,
HE SAID THE SAME OLD THING HE'S BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG; AND THAT IS THAT,
"I WILL DO BETTER. WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS." AND THAT HAPPENS IN BAD
RELATIONSHIPS AND IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS, DOESN'T IT? THINGS GET BAD,
BAD THINGS HAPPEN. IT'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY'S FAULT, BUT NOBODY WANTS TO
TAKE THE BLAME. AND IN THIS SITUATION, AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT
WHAT THE DEFENDANT DID WAS, HE MADE THESE PROMISES. HE SORT OF ROPED HER
BACK IN. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS IN A BAD RELATIONSHIP, "I'LL DO BETTER.
HERE'S A GIFT. I'M SORRY." THEY JUST ROPE YOU BACK INTO IT. AND IF YOU
ARE THE OTHER PERSON IN NICOLE'S POSITION AS SHE WAS -- AND THIS WILL BE
REFLECTED IN THE EVIDENCE -- SHE WANTED TO BELIEVE, SHE WANTED TO
BELIEVE THAT HER MARRIAGE COULD SURVIVE. SHE WANTED TO HAVE HOPE, AND HE
GAVE HER HOPE FOR A WHILE BECAUSE THIS IS A CYCLE. AND SO HE BEAT HER UP
ON JANUARY 1. HE ADMITTED TO HER PRIVATELY IN HIS LETTERS THAT HE WAS
RESPONSIBLE, AND HE APOLOGIZED AND HE GAVE HER THINGS AND HE TRIED TO
MAKE IT ALL BETTER, AND HE GAVE HER HOPE AND HE ROPED HER BACK IN, AND
SHE STAYED. SHE STAYED BECAUSE SHE HAD HOPE AND BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO
BELIEVE THAT JANUARY 1, 1989 WOULD BE THE LAST TIME THAT HE WOULD ABUSE
HER PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY. AS YOU HEAR THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE,
SOMETHING VERY SAD BECOMES VERY APPARENT. THEY MET WHEN SHE WAS 18 AND
HE WAS ALMOST 30, AND IN 1992, THEY DIVORCED. SHE WAS ONLY 33 YEARS OLD
AND SHE DIED WHEN SHE WAS ALMOST 35. THROUGHOUT HER ADULT LIFE,
THROUGHOUT MOST OF HER ADULT LIFE, HER CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE AND
RELATIONSHIP WAS DEFINED BY THIS DEFENDANT. THAT WAS ADULT LOVE. HER
NOTION OF ADULT LOVE FOR 15 YEARS WAS WHAT THIS DEFENDANT GAVE HER, AND
HE ABUSED HER THROUGHOUT THAT RELATIONSHIP. AS I SAID BEFORE, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES YOU GET ROPED IN. PEOPLE GET ROPED IN. NICOLE GOT ROPED IN BY
THE DEFENDANT, AND SHE STAYED AND SHE STAYED. AND PEOPLE STAY IN THOSE
SITUATIONS, THOSE ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS FOR YEARS AND YEARS UNTIL ONE OR
TWO THINGS HAPPEN; ONE, THEY JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, OR, TWO, UNTIL
THEY JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE AND THEY WAKE UP TO REALITY. AND
FINALLY, IN 1992, NICOLE WOKE UP TO THE REALITY OF HER SITUATION, AND IN
JANUARY 1992, SHE MOVED FROM ROCKINGHAM, SHE LEFT THE DEFENDANT AND SHE
FILED FOR DIVORCE. WELL, THIS DID NOT SIT WELL WITH THIS DEFENDANT AND
THIS WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE EVIDENCE. HE DID NOT LIKE THIS. HE DID NOT
LIKE THE FACT THAT NICOLE WAS LEAVING HIS HOUSE GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE TO
LIVE IN HER OWN HOUSE AWAY FROM HIM. THERE IS THAT ISSUE OF CONTROL. HOW
COULD HE CONTROL HER? SHE WASN'T RIGHT THERE WITH HIM. AND HE DIDN'T
TAKE IT WELL AND HE LOST 20 TO 25 POUNDS LIKE THAT (SNAPS FINGERS). AND
ALSO AND ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS, HE WOULD CALL HER SISTERS, DOMINIQUE
AND TONYA AND DENISE, AND HE WOULD CALL HER MOTHER AND HER FATHER
SOMETIMES CRYING ON THE TELEPHONE AND HE WOULD CALL THEM AND HE WOULD
WINE TO THEM AND, YOU KNOW, AND HE WOULD TELL THEM HOW MUCH HE LOVED HER
AND WANTED HER BACK. HE WOULD USE THEM TO TRY AND ROPE HER BACK IN.
WELL, SHE COULDN'T LET HIM GO, NOT COMPLETELY. AND HOW COULD SHE? SHE
HAD BEEN UNDER HIS CONTROL FOR 15 OR 16 YEARS. AND SO SHE DIDN'T GO TOO
FAR. SHE RENTED A HOUSE IN BRENTWOOD ON GRETNA GREEN. THEY SAW EACH
OTHER. THEY HAD CHILDREN TOGETHER, LOVELY CHILDREN. YOU'LL PROBABLY BE
SEEING A PICTURE OF ONE PRETTY SOON. BUT HE COULDN'T DEAL WITH THE LOSS
OF NICOLE. HE COULDN'T DEAL WITH NOT HAVING HER THERE. HE COULDN'T DEAL
WITH THE LOSS OF CONTROL AND HE COULDN'T HELP BUT PURSUE HER. YOU'LL
HEAR TESTIMONY IN THIS CASE FROM NICOLE'S MOTHER, AND SHE'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT SOME OF THE TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS SHE HAD WITH THE DEFENDANT IN
1992 AND SOME EVEN MORE RECENT. AND ONE CONVERSATION, HE TOLD HER, HE
TOLD HER, HE SAID, "ALL MY FRIENDS TELL ME THAT I SHOULD JUST LEAVE HER
ALONE, JUST FORGET ABOUT IT, JUST GO ON WITH MY OWN LIFE." AND WHEN MRS.
BROWN SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT, LET HER GO. IF YOU LET HER GO, THEN
MAYBE SHE'LL COME BACK TO YOU. JUST LET HER GO, AND MAYBE SHE'LL COME
BACK," AND HIS RESPONSE WAS, "I CAN'T. YOU KNOW I CAN'T. YOU KNOW I
CAN'T HELP MYSELF. I CAN'T LET HER GO." HE COULDN'T LET HER GO. HE
COULDN'T HELP BUT PURSUE HER. HE COULDN'T LEAVE HER ALONE. HE COULDN'T
HANDLE THE LOSS OF CONTROL. AND BECAUSE SHE HAD LEFT HIS HOUSE AND MOVED
SOMEWHERE ELSE AND ESTABLISHED HER OWN HOME, HER OWN HOUSE AND BEGAN
ESTABLISHING HER OWN RELATIONSHIPS, HE DID THE ONLY THING HE COULD DO TO
GAIN CONTROL, TO TRY TO GAIN CONTROL, TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING
ON WITH HER, AND SO HE STALKED HER. HE STALKED HER. WHEN SHE LEFT
ROCKINGHAM IN JANUARY OF '92 AND SET UP A NEW HOUSEHOLD ON GRETNA GREEN
ALSO IN BRENTWOOD, SHE BEGAN DATING A MAN NAMED KEITH, KEITH
ZLOMSOWITCH, AND SHE GOT A BABYSITTER FOR THEIR TWO CHILDREN. WHENEVER
KEITH AND NICOLE WOULD GO OUT, NOT EVERY TIME, BUT ENOUGH, HE WOULD SHOW
UP. IF THEY WENT TO A NIGHTCLUB -- AND KEITH WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THIS.
HE WILL BE HERE TO TESTIFY -- DEFENDANT SHOWED UP. THEY WENT TO A
RESTAURANT CALLED THE TRIST, IT HAD JUST OPENED, NICOLE AND KEITH AND
SOME OTHER FRIENDS. THEY WERE THERE, THEY GOT A TABLE, THEY BEGAN TO
HAVE DINNER. AND AS THEY SAT THERE HAVING DINNER, GUESS WHO SHOWED UP?
GUESS WHO ATTEMPTED TO GAIN CONTROL AGAIN? THE DEFENDANT SHOWED UP. AND
THAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE EVIDENCE AND IN THE TESTIMONY. AND WHAT HE
DID IS, HE WALKED INTO THE RESTAURANT, HE SAW NICOLE AND KEITH AND HER
OTHER FRIENDS, HE WENT TO ANOTHER TABLE, HE GRABBED THE CHAIR -- THE
CHAIR WAS FACING IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION -- HE GRABBED THE CHAIR, HE
TURNED IT AROUND, HE SAT THERE STARING AT KEITH AND NICOLE AND THEIR
DINNER PARTY. KEITH WILL BE HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT WAS AN AWFULLY
INTIMIDATING EXPERIENCE. WHY? THERE WAS ANOTHER INCIDENT AT THE
MEZZALUNA. NICOLE WAS THERE, KEITH WAS THERE. THE DEFENDANT SUDDENLY
SHOWED UP, DROVE UP IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT, GOT OUT OF THE CAR,
WALKED UP TO THE TABLE WHERE THEY WERE SEATED, PUT HIS HANDS ON AND
SAID, "I AM O.J. SIMPSON AND SHE'S STILL MY WIFE." WELL, SHE HAD FILED
FOR DIVORCE AND MOVED OUT OF HIS HOUSE. BUT THAT WAS INTIMIDATING. AND
THERE'S MORE, AND YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THE OTHER INCIDENTS. THERE'S MORE
EVIDENCE OF STALKING IN THIS CASE AND YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT. THERE WAS
ONE EVENING WHEN KEITH AND NICOLE, THEY WENT TO A COMEDY SHOW, AND AFTER
THE SHOW, THEY WENT TO NICOLE'S HOUSE ON GRETNA GREEN. IT WAS ABOUT 3:00
IN THE MORNING. AND THEY WERE SEATED ON THE SOFA IN HER LIVING ROOM. THE
KIDS, THE KIDS WERE UPSTAIRS ASLEEP. IT'S 3:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.
AND KEITH AND NICOLE MADE LOVE ON THE COUCH. BUT THEY WEREN'T ALONE.
THERE WAS SOMEBODY WATCHING. THERE WAS SOMEONE WATCHING THROUGH THE
WINDOW. IT WAS THE DEFENDANT. AT 3:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, HE WAS
LOOKING THROUGH NICOLE'S WINDOW WATCHING HER MAKE LOVE TO ANOTHER MAN.
AND THE NEXT DAY, WHEN KEITH AND NICOLE WERE TOGETHER, HE WALKED RIGHT
INTO HER HOUSE, AND HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF AND HE WAS ANGRY AND HE SAID
SOME VERY NAUGHTY THINGS. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE SAID TO KEITH
AND NICOLE WAS THAT, HE SAID, "I WATCHED YOU LAST NIGHT. I WATCHED YOU
AND I SAW EVERYTHING." THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THAT IS SOMEWHAT
UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR TO SAY THE LEAST. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW ALSO THAT THIS
IS ALL PART OF THIS CYCLE. IT'S ALL PART OF THIS DOMINANT THEME IN THEIR
RELATIONSHIP. THIS IS ALL PART OF HIS NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT HER,
TO KNOW WHERE SHE IS, TO KNOW WHO SHE'S WITH, TO KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING,
TO CONTROL HER. IT'S CONTROL. IT'S ALL ABOUT CONTROL. AND THOUGH HE DID
NOT INTERRUPT THEM DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE ACT AND HE DIDN'T PUNCH
KEITH OUT AND HE DIDN'T PUNCH NICOLE OUT, HE STILL WATCHED SO THAT HE
WOULD KNOW. AND TO CONTROL HER, HE HAD TO CONFRONT HER WITH WHAT HE
KNEW, TO INTIMIDATE HER, TO KEEP HER FROM DOING IT AGAIN. IT'S ALL ABOUT
CONTROL. WELL, OVER THE MONTHS, YOU KNOW, NICOLE STILL WANTED TO BELIEVE
THAT THEY COULD BE A FAMILY AGAIN TOGETHER. AND THEY WOULD ATTEMPT
RECONCILIATION AND THEY WOULD FAIL, AND THEY WOULD ATTEMPT AGAIN. AND
NICOLE WAS AS MUCH A PARTY TO THAT AS THE DEFENDANT WAS. BUT THERE WAS A
SITUATION IN OCTOBER OF 1993, AN INCIDENT, ANOTHER CONTROL INCIDENT. HE
FORCED HIS WAY THROUGH THE BACK DOOR OF HER PLACE ON GRETNA GREEN. HE
FORCED HER DOOR IN. HE ENTERED HER HOUSE WITHOUT HER PERMISSION, WITHOUT
HER KNOWLEDGE AND HE CONFRONTED HER AND HE SCARED HER, HE FRIGHTENED
HER. AND HE SCARED HER SO BADLY THAT SHE TELEPHONED 911, AND SHE ASKED
FOR POLICE ASSISTANCE. AND YOU WILL HEAR THE TAPE OF THAT 911 CALL AND
YOU WILL SEE THE 911 OPERATOR AND YOU WILL HEAR THE DEFENDANT IN THE
BACKGROUND. THIS IS OCTOBER 1993. HE WATCHED KEITH AND NICOLE HAVE SEX
IN APRIL OF 1992. AND WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE OCTOBER 1993 911 TAPE, YOU
CAN HEAR HIM IN THE BACKGROUND STILL YELLING AND SHOUTING ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED IN APRIL OF 1992. BUT THAT 911 TAPE IS A TELLING GLIMPSE INTO
THEIR RELATIONSHIP THAT'S FOR SURE, AND IT'S ALSO AN EXAMPLE OF THIS
DEFENDANT'S PRIVATE SIDE, HIS PRIVATE FACE, THE OTHER MAN, THE MAN IN
THE COURTROOM, THE MAN THAT'S ON TRIAL HERE TODAY. AND YOU WILL HEAR
NICOLE ON THE TELEPHONE TALKING TO THE OPERATOR. AND AS YOU LISTEN TO
HER, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT DISCERN FROM THE TONE OF HER VOICE AND THE
THINGS THAT SHE SAYS THAT SHE IS A TOUGH WOMAN, BUT THAT SHE'S ALSO
AFRAID AND INTIMIDATED. AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THAT SHE FEELS THAT HER
SITUATION IS HOPELESS. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT BY OCTOBER OF 1993,
NICOLE, HER SITUATION WAS HOPELESS AND SHE WAS HELPLESS. WAY BACK IN
1989, THE DEFENDANT SAID THAT THE POLICE HAD BEEN TO THE HOUSE EIGHT
TIMES BEFORE AND NEVER DONE ANYTHING. NICOLE SAID THE SAME THING ON THE
TELEPHONE TO THE 911 OPERATOR IN 1993. HER SITUATION WAS HOPELESS AND
SHE WAS HELPLESS. AND YOU CAN INFER FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT NICOLE BROWN
EXPECTED OR HAD NO EXPECTATION THAT ANYONE WOULD EVER DO ANYTHING TO
THIS DEFENDANT BECAUSE HE BEAT HER. THERE WAS NO HELP COMING AND SHE
DIDN'T EXPECT ANY HELP. BUT YOU WILL HEAR THAT TELEPHONE CALL AND YOU
WILL HEAR THE DEFENDANT AND YOU WILL GET A TRUE SENSE OF THE FEAR HE
INSTILLED IN HER. AND HE DIDN'T HIT HER THAT DAY. HE DIDN'T STRIKE HER.
HE DIDN'T PUNCH HER. HE DID GO THROUGH THE HOUSE TO SEE WHO WAS THERE,
BUT HE DIDN'T HURT HER THAT DAY. STILL, SHE STAYED. STILL, THEY REMAINED
INVOLVED, NOT ONLY IN A SENSE THAT HE WAS THE FATHER OF HER CHILDREN,
BUT THEY STILL ATTEMPTED TO RECONCILE. AND OVER THE MONTHS AFTER OCTOBER
OF 1993, THEY TRIED TO GET TOGETHER AND THEY FAILED, THEY TRIED TO GET
TOGETHER AND THEY FAILED. AND IN MAY OF 1994, IT WAS NICOLE'S BIRTHDAY,
AND THE DEFENDANT GAVE HER A VERY NICE GIFT, A PIECE OF JEWELRY. AND
THEY ATTEMPTED TO RECONCILE FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION, BUT THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT IT WAS A VERY BRIEF ATTEMPT BECAUSE A FEW DAYS
LATER, NICOLE CALLED IT QUITS. SHE WOKE UP TO THE TRUE REALITY OF HER
SITUATION. SHE COULDN'T BE BALKED ANYMORE. SHE COULDN'T LIVE LIKE THAT.
AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT SHE LET THE DEFENDANT KNOW THAT IT WAS
OVER. THIS IS IT, HASTA LA VISTA. AND THIS WAS SIGNIFICANT IN THE MIND
OF THIS DEFENDANT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE. HE WOULD DO THINGS TO HER AND HE WOULD TRY TO APPEASE
HER BY GIVING HER THINGS, AND SHE WOULD ACCEPT THOSE THINGS AND THEY
WOULD RECONCILE. BUT NOT THIS DAY. THIS DAY, SHE COULDN'T BE APPEASED.
SHE COULDN'T BE BOUGHT. SHE COULDN'T BE BRIBED. SHE HAD HAD ENOUGH. AND
THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT SHE LET THE DEFENDANT KNOW THAT. AND THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT FINALLY, AFTER 17 YEARS, HE FINALLY GOT THE
MESSAGE. IT FINALLY BECAME CLEAR THAT SHE WANTED TO LIVE HER OWN LIFE
AND THAT IN HER LIFE, THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE A PART OF IT. SHE
COULDN'T HANDLE IT. SHE WOKE UP TO REALITY. SHE WANTED TO LIVE AND HAVE
HER OWN IDENTITY. SHE NO LONGER WANTED TO BE UNDER HIS CONTROL, UNDER
HIS THUMB. SHE LET HIM KNOW THAT IT WAS OVER, THAT IT WAS OVER, IT WAS
OVER AND IT WAS FINAL, BUT THIS DEFENDANT'S PRIVATE SIDE, THE OTHER MAN,
NOT THE ONE ON T.V., THE DEFENDANT, HE COULDN'T TAKE THAT. HE COULDN'T
ACCEPT THAT. HE COULD NOT ACCEPT THAT LOSS OF CONTROL, AND HE WOULDN'T
AND HE DIDN'T. ON JUNE 12, A DANCE RECITAL WAS HELD IN BRENTWOOD FOR THE
DEFENDANT'S DAUGHTER SIDNEY. THE ENTIRE BROWN FAMILY WENT TO THE RECITAL
AS DID SOME FRIENDS, CANDICE GARVEY FOR INSTANCE. THE AUDITORIUM WAS
CROWDED. SO NOT EVERYONE COULD SIT, YOU KNOW, NEXT TO A FAMILY MEMBER.
AND SO THEIR PARTY WAS, YOU KNOW -- THERE WERE PEOPLE BETWEEN THEM. THEY
WERE SEPARATED SOMEWHAT AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAD TO SIT IN DIFFERENT
ROWS AND NOT ALL TOGETHER. WELL, THE DEFENDANT ARRIVED LATE AND HE
ARRIVED CARRYING A BOUQUET OF FLOWERS, FLOWERS HE HAD BOUGHT FOR HIS
DAUGHTER. WELL, WHEN HE WALKED INTO THE AUDITORIUM, HE GREETED JUST
ABOUT EVERYONE IN THE PARTY IN THE BROWN FAMILY. HE SAID HELLO TO THEM,
HE KISSED DENISE ON THE CHEEK, "HOW ARE YOU, HOW YOU DOING," WHATEVER,
AND HE PRETTY MUCH ADDRESSED EVERYBODY EXCEPT NICOLE. HE SAT BEHIND THE
BROWN'S FOR A FEW MOMENTS. AND THEN HE GOT UP AND HE GRABBED A CHAIR AND
HE DRAGGED IT IN THE CORNER OF THE AUDITORIUM AND HE TURNED THAT CHAIR
AROUND AND HE SAT IN IT, AND HE SAT THERE FACING NICOLE AND HE JUST
STARED AT HER. HE JUST SAT THERE STARING AT HER. AND YOU'LL HEAR
TESTIMONY ABOUT THIS, AND THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS WAS A
MENACING STARE, A PENETRATING STARE, IT WAS AN ANGRY STARE, AND IT MADE
EVERYONE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. WHEN THE RECITAL WAS OVER, THERE WAS A
LITTLE ISSUE WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFENDANT WAS ALLOWED TO GIVE SIDNEY
SOME FLOWERS, AND HE GAVE HER SOME FLOWERS. BUT THE BROWN FAMILY HAD
DECIDED TO GO OVER TO THE MEZZALUNA RESTAURANT FOR DINNER. AND AS THEY
LEFT, THEY MADE IT CLEAR TO THE DEFENDANT THAT HE WAS NOT INVITED, AND
HE WASN'T INVITED. AND BY NOT INVITING HIM, IT WAS A REAFFIRMATION OF
WHAT HE HAD ALREADY BEEN TOLD, AND THAT IS THAT IT WAS OVER. HE WAS NO
LONGER BEING TREATED AS A PART OF THE FAMILY. HE WAS NO LONGER THE
CENTRAL CENTERPIECE OF EVERY FAMILY OUTING. NICOLE WAS GETTING ON WITH
HER OWN LIFE. AND AS THE BROWN FAMILY LEFT, THEY LOOKED TOWARD THE
DEFENDANT AND THEY SAW HIM, AND HE WAS ANGRY AND HE WAS DEPRESSED AND
THEY WERE CONCERNED AND EVERYONE WONDERED WHAT IS HE UP TO NOW. MISS
CLARK WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT THE DEFENDANT WAS UP TO AS THE DAY
PROCEEDED ON. BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS
EVIDENCE AS YOU HEAR IT. THIS IS NOT CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. THIS IS
EVIDENCE OF A CONTROLLING PERSONALITY, OF A CONTROLLING RELATIONSHIP,
THIS PROOF OF JEALOUSY. AND AS MISS CLARK TALKS AND THE EVIDENCE
DEVELOPS IN THIS CASE AND AS YOU HEAR IT AND SEE IT AND PROCESS IT, YOU
WILL SEE THAT CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. YOU WILL SEE HOW THINGS ESCALATED.
YOU'LL SEE HOW CONTROLLING HE IS AND YOU'LL SEE WHY HE WOULD KILL ON
JUNE 12. THIS IS NOT CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. THIS IS NOT SOME TABLOID
PROSECUTION. THE EVIDENCE YOU HEAR IN THIS CASE WILL BE EVIDENCE OF THIS
DEFENDANT'S LIFE, OF HIS CONDUCT, THE THINGS HE DID. YOU WILL HEAR
EVIDENCE OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF THE VICTIMS. AND AS YOU HEAR
IT, YOU WILL -- AS YOU HEAR THE EVIDENCE AND AS YOU LISTEN TO MISS
CLARK, YOU'LL SEE HOW IT IS THAT RON GOLDMAN HAPPENED TO BE AT THE WRONG
PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. AS YOU LISTEN TO THE EVIDENCE, YOU WILL SEE
THAT HIS DECISION TO KILL FINALLY WAS MERELY A FINAL LINK IN A
PROGRESSIVE CHAIN OF ABUSIVE AND CONTROLLING CONDUCT, AND IT WAS A CHAIN
THAT CONSISTED OF FEAR AND INTIMIDATION AND BATTERY AND EMOTIONAL AND
MENTAL ABUSE AND ECONOMIC ABUSE AND CONTROL AND STALKING. AND YOU'LL SEE
THAT THERE WAS A COMMON SCHEME AND COMMON PLAN IN ALL OF THIS, AND THAT
WAS TO CONTROL, TO CONTROL HER. IT WAS ALL DESIGNED JUST TO CONTROL HER.
AND IN CONTROLLING HER, IT WAS THE PRIVATE MAN, PRIVATE O.J. SIMPSON, IT
WAS THE DEFENDANT WHO COMMITTED THAT FINAL ULTIMATE ACT OF CONTROL. SHE
LEFT HIM. SHE WAS NO LONGER IN HIS CONTROL. HE WAS OBSESSED WITH HER. HE
COULD NOT STAND TO LOSE HER, AND SO HE MURDERED HER. AND AS YOU HEAR THE
EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR THAT IN HIS MIND, SHE
BELONGED TO HIM; AND IF HE COULDN'T HAVE HER, THEN NOBODY COULD. THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

OPENING STATEMENT

BY MS. CLARK:

GOOD MORNING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

*THE JURY:* GOOD MORNING.

*MS. CLARK:* YOU'VE ALL SEEN ME FOR QUITE A WHILE, BUT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
MR. DARDEN. HE WAS BUSY WITH OTHER MATTERS. AND HE IS AN INTEGRAL PART
OF THIS CASE. LET ME INTRODUCE SOME OF THE LAWYERS YOU HAVEN'T MET, BUT
YOU WILL BE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL. MR. HANK GOLDBERG.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* GOOD MORNING.

*MS. CLARK:* MR. WOODY CLARK AND MR. ROCHMOND HARMON. THEY WILL ALL BE
PRESENTING THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE THAT RELATES TO THE
BLOOD ANALYSIS AND DNA TESTING. WHEN YOU HEAR THE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE
THAT WE HAVE, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY I NEED THE HELP. AND I THANK THEM
VERY MUCH FOR THEIR ABLE ASSISTANCE THUS FAR. OF COURSE, YOU KNOW MR.
HODGMAN. HE'S STILL HERE. YOU'VE NOW HEARD THE WHY. YOU'VE HEARD WHY.
WHY WOULD ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, A MAN WHO SEEMINGLY HAD IT ALL, COMMIT
SUCH HEINOUS CRIMES, THROW IT ALL AWAY? THE ONE SIMPLE TRUTH ABOUT THE
EVIDENCE DESCRIBED TO YOU BY MR. DARDEN IS THAT IT SHOWS THAT MR.
SIMPSON IS A MAN, NOT A STEREOTYPE, BUT FLESH AND BLOOD WHO CAN DO BOTH
GOOD AND EVIL. BEING WEALTHY, BEING FAMOUS CANNOT CHANGE ONE SIMPLE
TRUTH. HE'S A PERSON, AND PEOPLE HAVE GOOD SIDES AND BAD SIDES. WHETHER
YOU SEE BOTH SIDES OR NOT, BOTH SIDES ARE ALWAYS THERE. NOW, WE WILL
SHOW YOU THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SMILING FACE YOU SAW IN THE HERTZ
COMMERCIAL, THE ONE YOU NEVER SAW ON CAMERA, THE ONE NONE OF US EVER
WANTED TO SEE. AND THAT WAS THE SIDE THAT WENT FROM ROCKINGHAM AT HIS
ESTATE TO NICOLE'S HOME AT 875 SOUTH BUNDY ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE
12TH, 1994. NOW, ON THAT NIGHT, MANY EVENTS WERE HAPPENING AT THE SAME
TIME. AND IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU A TRUE PICTURE, THE MOST CLEAR AND
ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, HOW THE EVENTS OCCURRED, I'M
GOING TO GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND BETWEEN THE
LOCATIONS. SO WHAT I WANT TO DO FIRST OF ALL IS DESCRIBE THE SETTING FOR
YOU. AS OF JUNE THE 12TH, 1994, NICOLE WAS LIVING AT 875 SOUTH BUNDY IN
BRENTWOOD. THAT'S A CONDOMINIUM. IT WAS A DUPLEX. AND SO IT'S ONE
BUILDING. SHE HAD ONE SIDE, HAD A COMMON WALL AND HER NEIGHBORS HAD
ANOTHER SIDE. SHE LIVED THERE WITH HER TWO CHILDREN, JUSTIN AND SIDNEY.
THE DEFENDANT WAS LIVING AT 360 ROCKINGHAM AVENUE IN BRENTWOOD. BRIAN
KAELIN, KNOWN AS KATO -- YOU'VE -- SOME OF YOU ALREADY ARE FAMILIAR WITH
THE NAME -- WAS LIVING IN ONE OF THE GUEST UNITS BEHIND THE DEFENDANT'S
HOME ON ROCKINGHAM AVENUE. THE DEFENDANT'S DAUGHTER ARNELLE LIVED NEXT
TO KATO IN ANOTHER ONE OF THE GUEST UNITS. I'LL SHOW YOU A DIAGRAM A
LITTLE BIT LATER TO GET YOU MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE LOCATION. BUT THE
GUEST UNITS ARE BEHIND AND APART FROM THE MAIN HOUSE AND THEY SHARE
COMMON WALLS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE ONE LONG BUILDING. SO KATO HAD ONE AND
THEN ARNELLE HAD THE NEXT ONE. NOW, THE BACKGROUND ON KATO AND WHAT THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW YOU IS THE FOLLOWING: KATO MET NICOLE IN 1992 AFTER
SHE HAD LEFT THE DEFENDANT AT A PARTY IN ASPEN. THEY REMAINED FRIENDLY
AFTER THAT POINT NOT ROMANTICALLY; PLATONIC, JUST FRIENDS. AND HE WENT
TO A PARTY THAT SHE GAVE AT GRETNA GREEN IN 1993. HE NOTICED THAT THAT
HOUSE HAD A GUEST UNIT BEHIND IT THAT WAS A SEPARATE LIVING QUARTERS,
AND HE ASKED NICOLE IF HE COULD RENT THAT LOCATION. SHE SAID YES. SHE
RENTED IT TO HIM FOR $450 TO $500 A MONTH AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO REDUCE
THAT AMOUNT IF HE DID BABY-SITTING FOR HER. HE WAS VERY GOOD WITH THE
CHILDREN. SO THAT WAS AN ARRANGEMENT THAT WORKED WELL FOR EVERYONE.
HOWEVER, NICOLE DECIDED TO MOVE OUT OF GRETNA GREEN IN 1994, AND SHE
FOUND THE RESIDENCE ON BUNDY THAT I'VE DESCRIBED TO YOU. NOW, THE BUNDY
RESIDENCE DID HAVE SEPARATE QUARTERS WITH ITS OWN ENTRANCE AND EXIT, BUT
IT WAS ALL UNDER ONE ROOF. IT DIDN'T HAVE A SEPARATE LIVING QUARTERS
LIKE THE OTHER HOUSE DID ON GRETNA GREEN. THE DEFENDANT ASKED KATO NOT
TO STAY THERE, NOT TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF AS NICOLE SAYING IT
WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE, AND HE ASKED KATO TO COME STAY IN ONE OF THE
GUEST UNITS AT HIS HOUSE ON ROCKINGHAM. HE TOLD KATO HE COULD STAY THERE
FOR FREE. KATO OBVIOUSLY SAW A MUCH BETTER FINANCIAL SITUATION FOR
HIMSELF AND AGREED. AND SO IN JANUARY OF 1994, KATO MOVED TO THE GUEST
UNIT BEHIND THE DEFENDANT'S HOUSE ON ROCKINGHAM AND NICOLE MOVED TO 875
SOUTH BUNDY. LET ME SHOW YOU A BOARD NOW OF THE ROCKINGHAM LOCATION.

*THE COURT:* MS. CLARK, WOULD YOU BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THAT FOR COUNSEL.

*MS. CLARK:* THE DEFENSE HAS SEEN IT.

*THE COURT:* JUST SO THEY KNOW WHICH ONE.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS ONE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

*THE COURT:* SO WE CAN TELL WHICH ONE IT IS.

*MS. CLARK:* SHALL I MARK IT NOW? 360 NORTH ROCKINGHAM AVENUE. SHALL I
JUST DESCRIBE IT?

*MR. COCHRAN:* CAN WE HAVE THAT MARKED?

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS AN OVERALL DIAGRAM OF THE DEFENDANT'S HOME ON
ROCKINGHAM AVENUE IN BRENTWOOD. THIS LOCATION HERE, THIS AREA HERE IS
THE MAIN HOUSE. THIS -- THESE ROOMS THAT ARE SHOWN DOWN HERE ARE THE
GUEST UNITS (INDICATING). NOW, THE GUEST UNITS ARE CLOSED OFF. THEY ARE
LOCKED OFF WITH A DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN'T ENTER FROM THE GUEST UNIT INTO
THE MAIN HOUSE. YOU SEE THE AREA HERE. IT'S MARKED KAELIN'S ROOM. I
DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ALL READ IT. THAT'S WHY I'M POINTING IT OUT FOR
YOU. THAT IS KATO'S GUEST UNIT (INDICATING). RIGHT NEXT TO HIS UNIT --

*THE COURT:* EXCUSE ME. MISS CLARK, WOULD YOU ALLOW MR. COCHRAN TO STEP
OVER TO YOUR RIGHT SO HE CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE POINTING?

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU KINDLY, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. THIS IS AN OFFICE THAT KATO HAD
ACCESS TO AND THIS WOULD BE ARNELLE'S ROOM RIGHT NEXT TO KATO'S
(INDICATING). NOW, THE ROCKINGHAM ADDRESS ALSO HAD -- IT HAD A GATE THAT
OPENED ON TO ASHFORD STREET ON THE NORTH AND A GATE THAT OPENED ON TO
ROCKINGHAM ON THE WEST SIDE. I'LL GET INTO MORE DETAIL LATER. NOW,
BEFORE I REALLY GET INTO THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH AND
INTO ALL THE DETAILS, THERE ARE A FEW KEY POINTS THAT I WANT TO BRING
OUT TO YOU RIGHT NOW. I'LL COME BACK TO THEM AGAIN, BUT I WANT YOU TO
BEAR THEM IN MIND. THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE TIMING OF THE EVENTS THAT
HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THAT
THROUGHOUT THIS TRIAL. I THINK I CAN GUARANTEE THAT. WITH RESPECT TO THE
TIMING, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH, 1994,
THE DEFENDANT HAD AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES OF TIME IN WHICH HIS
WHEREABOUTS ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR. AND WE WILL SHOW THAT IT WAS DURING
THAT HOUR AND 10 MINUTES THAT THE MURDERS WERE COMMITTED. AND SO THE
EVIDENCE WILL PROVE THAT KATO LAST SAW THE DEFENDANT ON THE NIGHT OF
JUNE THE 12TH AT 9:35 AT THE LATEST, HE DID NOT SEE THE DEFENDANT AGAIN
UNTIL 10 -- EXCUSE ME -- AFTER 11:00 O'CLOCK. IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO
TIMES, AT 10:15, A DOG IS HEARD BARKING THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW WAS
NICOLE'S DOG, WHICH FIXES THE TIME AT WHICH THE MURDER OCCURRED. AT
10:45, KATO HEARD THUMPS ON HIS WALL. AND SHORTLY AFTER 11:00, HE SAW
THE DEFENDANT. AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES DURING WHICH THE MURDER OCCURRED
-- MURDERS OCCURRED IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT'S WHEREABOUTS ARE UNACCOUNTED
FOR. I'LL COME BACK TO THAT POINT. NOW, ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH,
AS MR. DARDEN HAS ALREADY DESCRIBED TO YOU, THAT WAS THE RECITAL FOR
SIDNEY. IT WAS A DANCE RECITAL FOR HER SCHOOL. ON THE MORNING OF JUNE
THE 12TH, THE DEFENDANT PLAYED GOLF, PLAYED CARDS AND HE WAS SCHEDULED
TO GO TO THE RECITAL AT 5:00 P.M. ON THE EVENING OF JUNE THE 12TH. MR.
DARDEN DESCRIBED TO YOU HOW DEFENDANT BEHAVED THAT NIGHT. HE WAS IN AN
UGLY MOOD, MOROSE, DEPRESSED AND CLEARLY FIXATED ON HIS EX-WIFE NICOLE
BROWN. HE RETURNED HOME AFTER THE RECITAL AND HE SPOKE TO KATO. IT WAS
APPROXIMATELY 6:30 TO 7:00 P.M. HE RETURNED HOME, TO HIS HOME ON
ROCKINGHAM. NOW, ABOUT THAT SAME TIME, 6:30 TO 7:00 P.M., NICOLE WAS
ARRIVING AT THE MEZZALUNA WITH HER PARTY, THAT WAS ALL OF HER FAMILY AND
SIDNEY AND JUSTIN. NOW, BACK AT ROCKINGHAM, MR. SIMPSON SPOKE TO KATO.
HE DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT THE RECITAL, WHAT HE WANTED TO TELL HIM ABOUT
IT AND HE MENTIONED TO HIM THAT NICOLE WAS WEARING A TIGHT DRESS AND HE
WONDERED HOW SHE WOULD LOOK IN THAT TIGHT DRESS WHEN SHE GOT TO BE
OLDER. DURING THE COURSE OF THAT DAY, HE ALSO TOLD KATO THAT HE AND
NICOLE WERE THROUGH. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE DEFENDANT WOULD
MAKE STATEMENTS SOUNDING LIKE HE WAS CAVALIER ABOUT IT. BUT THE TRUTH
THAT WE LEARN FROM THE INSIDE IS THAT HE WAS NOT AT ALL CAVALIER ABOUT
LOSING NICOLE. NOW, WHILE THE DEFENDANT IS TALKING TO KATO ON
ROCKINGHAM, NICOLE AND HER PARTY ARRIVED AT THE MEZZALUNA FOR DINNER TO
CELEBRATE SIDNEY'S RECITAL. RON GOLDMAN WAS A WAITER AT THE MEZZALUNA.
HE DIDN'T WAIT ON HER TABLE THAT NIGHT, BUT HE WAS WORKING THERE THAT
NIGHT. NICOLE WAS WEARING A BLACK HALTER DRESS AND A BLACK BLAZER. SHE
LEFT THE RESTAURANT WITH HER FAMILY AT APPROXIMATELY 8:30 P.M. NOW,
BETWEEN 8:30 AND 9:00 P.M., KATO WAS BACK IN HIS ROOM, AND THE DEFENDANT
CAME OUT TO HIS ROOM TO ASK HIM FOR SOME CHANGE. THE DEFENDANT WAS SET
TO TAKE A FLIGHT OUT THAT NIGHT TO CHICAGO, THE 11:45 RED EYE. HE
INDICATED TO KATO THAT HE ONLY HAD HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS AND HE NEEDED
SMALLER CHANGE FOR THE SKY CAP. HE ASKED KATO IF HE HAD THAT SMALLER
CHANGE AND KATO SAID HE DID. HE THEN TOLD KATO THAT HE WAS GOING TO GO
OUT AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT. KATO ASKED IF HE COULD COME ALONG. THE
DEFENDANT SAID OKAY. THEY THEN LEFT AND THEY WENT OUT TO THE DRIVEWAY.
THE DEFENDANT DROVE TO MC DONALD'S IN HIS BLACK BENTLEY. THEY GOT SOME
BURGERS. AND AS HE DROVE BACK, THE DEFENDANT ATE HIS FOOD WHILE HE WAS
DRIVING. KATO DID NOT. THEY GOT BACK TO 365 ROCKINGHAM, AND THE
DEFENDANT PARKED HIS BENTLEY IN THE DRIVEWAY IN THE SAME POSITION IN
WHICH IT WAS FOUND BY THE POLICE IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE THE
13TH. WHEN KATO GOT OUT OF THE CAR, IT WAS 9:30 TO 9:35 AT THE LATEST.
AND WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE CAR, HE LAST SAW THE DEFENDANT STANDING NEAR
THE BENTLEY. KATO WALKED THROUGH THE DRIVEWAY, THROUGH THE SIDE YARD AND
BACK TO HIS ROOM. AS SOON AS HE GOT BACK TO HIS ROOM, HE MADE A CALL TO
HIS FRIEND IN SAN DIEGO AT 9:37. SO WE KNOW THAT THE DEFENDANT GOT HOME
BETWEEN 9:30 TO 9:35 AT THE VERY LATEST BASED ON THE TIMING OF THE PHONE
CALL THAT KATO PLACED TO HIS FRIEND IN SAN DIEGO. WHEN KATO LEFT THE
DEFENDANT STANDING AT THE BENTLEY AT 9:35, HE DID NOT SEE THE DEFENDANT
AGAIN UNTIL AFTER 11:00 P.M. NOW, WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE TO YOU IS A
SERIES OF EVENTS THAT PROVES THAT THE MURDERS OCCURRED BETWEEN 9:35 AND
10:45 ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE THE 12TH AND THAT DURING THAT TIME, THE
DEFENDANT'S WHEREABOUTS ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR. AT 9:37, JUDITHA BROWN,
THAT IS NICOLE'S MOTHER, CALLED THE MEZZALUNA TO SEE IF THEY HAD FOUND
HER PRESCRIPTION GLASSES THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD LEFT THERE AT DINNER
THAT NIGHT. KAREN CRAWFORD, THE BAR MANAGER FROM MEZZALUNA, TOOK THAT
CALL AND THEN WENT TO LOOK FOR THE GLASSES. SHE FOUND THEM OUT IN THE
GUTTER NEAR WHERE THE FAMILY HAD GOTTEN OUT OF THEIR CAR TO COME INTO
THE RESTAURANT. SHE BROUGHT THEM BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT, TOLD JUDITHA
THAT SHE HAD FOUND THEM. JUDITHA ASKED HER TO KEEP THE GLASSES THERE. SO
MISS CRAWFORD PUT THEM INTO AN ENVELOPE MARKED "NICOLE SIMPSON
PRESCRIPTION GLASSES". WE'LL SHOW YOU PHOTOGRAPHS OF THAT ENVELOPE
TODAY. NOW, JUDITHA CALLED NICOLE AT 9:40 P.M. AND TOLD HER THAT THE
GLASSES HAD BEEN FOUND AND WERE BEING KEPT AT THE MEZZALUNA AT 9:40 P.M.
AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME JUDITHA EVER SPOKE TO HER DAUGHTER NICOLE. A
FEW MINUTES LATER, MISS CRAWFORD RECEIVED A CALL FROM NICOLE, AND THEY
SPOKE. MISS CRAWFORD THEN CALLED RON GOLDMAN OVER TO THE PHONE. RON
GOLDMAN SPOKE TO NICOLE FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND WHEN HE WAS DONE AND HE
HUNG UP, MISS CRAWFORD GAVE HIM THE GLASSES, AND HE TOOK THE ENVELOPE
CONTAINING THOSE GLASSES. SHORTLY THEREAFTER AT APPROXIMATELY 9:50 P.M.,
RON GOLDMAN LEFT THE RESTAURANT STILL DRESSED IN HIS WAITER'S UNIFORM,
THE WHITE DRESS SHIRT, THE BLACK PANTS AND THE BLACK SHOES. AND HIS
FRIENDS AT THE RESTAURANT NEVER AGAIN SAW HIM ALIVE.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK, WHICH GRAPHIC IS THIS?

*MS. CLARK:* I AM SORRY?

*THE COURT:* WHICH GRAPHIC IS THIS?

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS A VIEW OF THE ALLEY.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WHAT ITEM? WHAT EXHIBIT NUMBER?

*MS. CLARK:* I AM SORRY?

*THE COURT:* WHAT EXHIBIT NUMBER JUST FOR THE RECORD SO WE CAN
DEMONSTRATE --

*MS. CLARK:* I AM SORRY. P-1. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 P.M., PABLO
FENJVES, WHO LIVED DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE ALLEY BEHIND NICOLE'S
CONDOMINIUM, HEARD A DOG BEGIN TO BARK. THE AREA YOU SEE HERE IN THE
PHOTOGRAPH -- AND I'LL TRY TO DESIGNATE IT WITH THE RED LIGHT -- THIS IS
THE ALLEY BEHIND HER HOUSE, BEHIND NICOLE'S HOUSE AT 875 SOUTH BUNDY.
THIS JEEP THAT YOU SEE HERE IS HER JEEP (INDICATING). PABLO FENJVES, WHO
I'VE JUST DESCRIBED, LIVED IN THE AREA WHERE YOU SEE THE POLICE CAR. THE
LIGHTS THAT YOU SEE HERE ON THE BALCONY INDICATE WHERE NICOLE LIVED.
THAT'S HER CONDOMINIUM (INDICATING). THIS IS A REAR VIEW AGAIN OF
NICOLE'S -- THE REAR OF NICOLE'S CONDOMINIUM. THAT'S HER JEEP. THAT'S
HER GARAGE THAT I'M INDICATING, AND THIS IS THE BALCONY AREA I INDICATED
BEFORE AND THERE'S THE UPSTAIRS AREA (INDICATING).

*THE COURT:* IS THIS PEOPLE'S 2?

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS P-2.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS GARAGE AND THESE LIVING QUARTERS HERE BELONG TO
ANOTHER FAMILY (INDICATING). AS I INDICATED BEFORE, IT'S A DUPLEX. SO AT
10:15, PABLO FENJVES HEARD A DOG BARK. HE REMEMBERED IT CLEARLY BECAUSE
THE BARK WAS LIKE A PLAINTIVE INSISTENT WAIL. IT WAS LIKE NOTHING HE
EVER HEARD BEFORE. ALTHOUGH HE HEARD DOGS BARK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS
OTHER DOGS LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THIS WAS DIFFERENT. THIS DOG
SOUNDED LIKE A DOG IN TROUBLE. AT 11:00 P.M., WHEN PABLO FENJVES WENT TO
BED, THE DOG WAS STILL BARKING. HE WENT OVER TO HIS -- BACK TO HIS
BEDROOM SHUTTERS AND OPENED THEM TO LOOK OUT IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE
BARKING SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM AND HE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION OF
NICOLE'S CONDOMINIUM, WHICH IS THE DIRECTION THAT IT SEEMED TO BE COMING
FROM, AND HE NOTICED THAT THERE WERE LIGHTS ON IN THE UPPER FLOOR OF HER
CONDO. WHEN HE FELL ASLEEP SHORTLY AFTER 11:00 O'CLOCK, THE DOG WAS
STILL BARKING. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THIS DOG WAILING AND BARKING
SO INSISTENTLY WAS NICOLE'S WHITE AKIDA KATO. ANOTHER NEIGHBOR, STEVE
SCHWAB, LEFT TO TAKE HIS DOG FOR A WALK AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30. AT ABOUT
10:55, WHEN HE GOT TO THE CORNER OF DOROTHY AND BUNDY, WHICH IS RIGHT ON
THE CORNER OF NICOLE'S -- WHERE NICOLE LIVED, MAYBE ONE HOUSE DOWN, HE
SAW KATO THE DOG WALKING ALONE. THE DOG WAS ACTING VERY AGITATED, SEEMED
TO BE BARKING AT THE HOUSE ON THE CORNER OF DOROTHY AND BUNDY. HE
COULDN'T TELL WHICH ONE, AND HE NOTICED THAT THE DOG HAD AN EXPENSIVE
COLLAR. WHEN HE CHECKED IT FURTHER, LOOKING FOR TAGS, HE NOTICED THAT
THERE WAS BLOOD ON THE PAWS AND ON THE LEGS OF THE DOG. ALTHOUGH AT THAT
TIME HE SAW NO INJURY, HE ASSUMED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A CUT ON THE PAW
TO CAUSE ALL THAT BLOOD. AS HE CONTINUED TO WALK, THE DOG BEGAN TO
FOLLOW HIM, BUT IT BEHAVED IN A VERY STRANGE MANNER BECAUSE AT THE
WALKWAY TO EVERY HOUSE THAT THEY PASSED, THE DOG WOULD STOP AND BARK
INSISTENTLY. WHEN STEVE GOT HOME AT APPROXIMATELY 11:05, HE AND HIS WIFE
DISCUSSED WHAT TO DO WITH THIS DOG. THEY SAT OUTSIDE AND GAVE IT SOME
WATER BECAUSE IT SEEMED VERY DEHYDRATED AND DECIDED TO TRY TO GET IT TO
LEAD THEM TO ITS OWNER'S HOME. SO THEY TOOK IT OUT AND THEY STARTED TO
WALK BACK. BUT AS THEY NEARED BUNDY, THE DOG RESISTED, THE DOG PULLED
BACK AND THEY COULDN'T GET IT TO GO ANY FARTHER. SO HE TOOK THE DOG BACK
TO THE COURTYARD OF THEIR APARTMENT BUILDING. NOW, IN THAT COURTYARD,
THERE WAS MORE LIGHT AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE MORE CLEARLY THAT THERE
WAS NO INJURY ON THE DOG, BUT THAT ITS PAWS AND ITS LEGS WERE CLEARLY
BLOODY. NOW, STEVE SCHWAB LATER GAVE THAT DOG TO ANOTHER NEIGHBOR IN HIS
APARTMENT BUILDING, SUKRU BOZTEPE. YOU WILL SEE THEM TESTIFY IN THIS
COURTROOM. AND SUKRU BOZTEPE AGREED TO TAKE CARE OF THE DOG FOR THE
NIGHT. BUT AGAIN, THE DOG WAS ACTING VERY AGITATED WITH SUKRU BOZTEPE.
HE TRIED TO TAKE HIM INSIDE THE HOUSE AND HE WAS NICHING AND SCRATCHING
AND TRYING TO GET OUT. SO HE TRIED TO DO THE SAME THING THAT STEVE DID,
AND HE TOOK THE DOG OUT FOR A WALK HOPING IT WOULD LEAD HIM BACK TO THE
OWNER'S HOME. AS THEY WENT SOUTH ON BUNDY, THE DOG STARTED PULLING
HARDER AND HARDER UNTIL THEY GOT TO THE LOCATION OF 875 SOUTH BUNDY. AND
THERE AT THE PATHWAY LEADING UP TO THAT HOME, THE DOG STOPPED AND THE
DOG LOOKED UP THE PATHWAY. AND THAT MADE SUKRU LOOK UP THE PATHWAY, AND
THERE HE SAW A SIGHT THAT HE'LL NEVER FORGET. HE SAW THE BODY OF NICOLE
BROWN LYING AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS IN A POOL OF BLOOD. NOW, I'M GOING
TO BACKTRACK FOR A MOMENT AND TALK ABOUT ROCKINGHAM. I LAST MENTIONED
KATO AT 9:35. HE WAS ON THE PHONE TO HIS FRIEND IN SAN DIEGO. HE WAS ON
THAT PHONE FOR SEVEN MINUTES. THAT CALL ENDED AT 9:44, AT WHICH POINT,
AFTER TRYING TO USE THE TYPEWRITER IN THAT OFFICE I SHOWED YOU BEFORE,
WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT TO HIS GUEST UNIT -- THIS MUST BE THE ROOM RIGHT
HERE (INDICATING) -- HE CALLED HIS FRIEND RACHEL FERRARA.

*THE COURT:* WHY DON'T YOU FINISH THE THOUGHT, MISS CLARK.

*MS. CLARK:* YOU WANT TO TAKE A BREAK? IT GOES INTO -- IT'S KIND OF
BETTER TO BREAK HERE IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH THE COURT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'RE GOING TO
TAKE OUR RECESS FOR THE LUNCH HOUR. MISS CLARK, COULD YOU TAKE THE
POSTER DOWN, PLEASE?

*MS. CLARK:* YES.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'RE GOING TO
TAKE OUR RECESS FOR THE LUNCH HOUR. PLEASE REMEMBER MY ADMONITION TO
YOU; DON'T DISCUSS THE CASE AMONGST YOURSELVES, FORM ANY OPINIONS ABOUT
THE CASE, TALK TO ANYBODY ABOUT THE CASE OR ALLOW ANYBODY TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT IT. AND WE WILL SEE YOU BACK HERE AT 1:30. ALL RIGHT. HAVE A NICE
LUNCH.

(AT 12:01 P.M., THE NOON RECESS WAS TAKEN UNTIL 1:30 P.M. OF THE SAME DAY.)

APPEARANCES: (APPEARANCES AS HERETOFORE NOTED.)

(JANET M. MOXHAM, CSR NO. 4855, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(CHRISTINE M. OLSON, CSR NO. 2378, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON, COUNSEL. IS THERE ANYTHING WE
NEED TO ADDRESS BEFORE WE INVITE THE JURORS TO REJOIN US? MR. COCHRAN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* JUST BRIEFLY, YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY
KINDLY, YOUR HONOR, AND I WILL BE VERY BRIEF. THIS MORNING, YOUR HONOR,
I HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL CALLS REGARDING THE WITNESS ROSA LOPEZ AND AT
NOON I SPOKE WITH HER PERSONALLY. SHE INDICATES SHE HAS BEEN BESIEGED BY
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRYING TO EITHER INTERVIEW HER, THE PRESS IS OUTSIDE
OF HER HOUSE, SHE CAN'T GET OUT OF HER DRIVEWAY OR WHERE SHE WORKS. SHE
IS VERY, VERY AFRAID THAT IN THESE HARSH ECONOMIC TIMES SHE MAY LOSE HER
JOB. HER LAWYER, CARL JONES, HAS WRITTEN A LETTER ASKING, SHOULD THE
PEOPLE WANT TO INTERVIEW HER, HE WILL ARRANGE IT AND NOT TO TRY TO COME
ON HER JOB. SHE WORKS AS A HOUSEKEEPER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COURT CAN
DO ABOUT THE PRESS, BUT SHE WAS REALLY EXASPERATED WHEN I TALKED TO HER,
AND PERHAPS THE COURT CAN APPEAL TO THE GOOD SIDE OF THE PRESS AND ASK
THEM IF THEY WOULD GIVE HER SOME PRIVACY. SHE IS VERY, VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT HERSELF AND HER FAMILY AND SHE FEELS IT IS UNFAIR. I THOUGHT I
SHOULD BRING IT TO YOUR HONOR'S ATTENTION BECAUSE I GOT A CALL HERE --
SEVERAL CALLS HERE IN COURT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. DARDEN, DO YOU HAVE SOME RESPONSIVE COMMENT
ON THAT?

*MR. DARDEN:* YES, YOUR HONOR, THANK YOU, AND I APPRECIATE MR. COCHRAN'S
COMMENTS. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO INDICATE THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN PART OF THE
HARASSMENT, WE HAVEN'T ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT MISS LOPEZ, AS MR. DOUGLAS
ALLUDED TO YESTERDAY, AND I WOULD JOIN IN MR. COCHRAN'S REQUEST THAT
THIS WITNESS, AS OTHER WITNESSES IN THE CASE, NOT BE HARASSED BY THE
MEDIA, BY THE PUBLIC. LEAVE THESE PEOPLE ALONE. IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT
THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE WITNESSES IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS SIMPSON.
AND WE WILL CONTACT MR. JONES AT THE PROPER TIME AND BEFORE WE ATTEMPT
TO INTERVIEW MISS LOPEZ.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU. WE JOIN AND AGREE ON SOMETHING, YOUR HONOR,
AND WE WELCOME YOUR SUGGESTION TO THE PRESS IF YOU HAVE ONE.

*THE COURT:* I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

*MR. DARDEN:* BEFORE THE JURY COMES IN, YOUR HONOR, IF WE COULD HAVE A
MOMENT?

*THE COURT:* YES.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. DARDEN:* WE ARE MISSING SOMEONE, IF I COULD JUST STEP OUTSIDE FOR
ONE MOMENT.

*THE COURT:* SURE.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MS. CLARK:* MAY I USE THE PHONE, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* I'M SORRY?

*MS. CLARK:* MAY I USE THE PHONE?

*THE COURT:* BRIEFLY.

*MS. CLARK:* FOR THE SAME PURPOSE THAT MR. DARDEN IS GOING OUTSIDE.

*THE COURT:* WHO ARE WE MISSING?

*MS. CLARK:* OUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS CLARK, ARE WE READY TO PROCEED? ARE WE
READY TO PROCEED?

*MS. CLARK:* YES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. DEPUTY MAGNERA.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, IN THE PRESENCE OF
THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. BE SEATED. LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU. BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. MR.
SIMPSON IS AGAIN PRESENT BEFORE THE COURT WITH HIS COUNSEL. THE PEOPLE
ARE REPRESENTED. AND WE HAVE ALL THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY PANEL AGAIN
PRESENT WITH US. MISS CLARK, DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE YOUR OPENING
STATEMENT?

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

OPENING STATEMENT (RESUMED)

BY MS. CLARK:

GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

*THE JURY:* GOOD AFTERNOON.

*MS. CLARK:* I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE A VERY IMPORTANT MEMBER OF OUR TEAM,
AND I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. JONATHAN FAIRTLOUGH, WHO IS A NEW
MEMBER OF OUR OFFICE, AND HE DOES ALL THE TECHNICAL WORK YOU ARE SEEING
HERE AND I WOULDN'T HAVE A CLUE HOW TO OPERATE THESE THINGS. WITHOUT HIM
I AM IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A VERY GOOD LUNCH. LET ME
REMIND YOU WHERE WE LEFT OFF SO THAT WE CAN PICK UP FROM THERE. WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT THE TIMING AND I WAS DISCUSSING WITH YOU THAT KATO HAD
LAST SEEN THE DEFENDANT AT 9:35 AT ROCKINGHAM AND THAT IT WAS AFTER
11:00 BEFORE HE SAW HIM AGAIN, SO HE SAW THE DEFENDANT AT 9:35, DID NOT
SEE HIM AGAIN UNTIL AFTER 11:00, AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME THE
DEFENDANT'S WHEREABOUTS ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR. NOW, LAST I SPOKE TO YOU
KATO WAS ON THE PHONE WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND, RACHEL FERRARA. AT THAT TIME
-- AT THAT SAME TIME THAT HE WAS ON THE TELEPHONE, AND THIS WAS PROBABLY
10:00 TO 10:15, ALLAN PARK, A LIMOUSINE DRIVER, WAS ON HIS WAY TO
ROCKINGHAM TO PICK UP THE DEFENDANT TO TAKE HIM TO THE AIRPORT WHERE HE
WOULD TAKE HIS FLIGHT AT 11:45 TO CHICAGO. NOW, ALTHOUGH HIS
INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO ARRIVE AT ROCKINGHAM AT 10:45, HE HADN'T BEEN IN
THE BRENTWOOD AREA BEFORE AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE LATE, SO HE LEFT
EARLY AND HE ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM AT 10:25. NOW, I'M GOING TO USE THE
DIAGRAM AGAIN.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MS. CLARK:* WHEN ALLAN PARK PULLED UP ON ASHFORD STREET HE PARKED
ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE DEFENDANT'S RESIDENCE, GOT OUT OF HIS CAR,
SAT BEHIND IT ON THE CURB AND HAD A CIGARETTE. HE GOT BACK IN HIS CAR AT
ABOUT 10:30, SAT IN HIS CAR FOR A FEW MINUTES LISTENING TO THE RADIO.
AND AT 10:35 HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD GO AND LOOK AT THE ROCKINGHAM GATE
TO SEE IF THAT DRIVE IN WOULD BE EASIER FOR HIM THAN THE ASHFORD STREET
GATE. WHAT I SHOULD TELL YOU RIGHT HERE IS THAT HE WAS DRIVING A STRETCH
LIMOUSINE AND THAT HAS A VERY HARD TIME MAKING TIGHT CURVES. HE WANTED
TO BE ABLE TO PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE FRONT DOOR TO AN AREA THAT WOULD
BE EASIER TO LOAD THE BAGGAGE, SO HE WANTED TO SEE IF THE ROCKINGHAM
ENTRANCE WOULD BE MORE EASY FOR HIM THAN THE ASHFORD STREET ADDRESS. SO
HE DECIDED TO PULL DOWN TO ROCKINGHAM. HE PULLED THE LIMOUSINE DOWN TO
ROCKINGHAM, ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW
WOULD BE PARALLEL WITH THE ROCKINGHAM GATE, SO HE COULD LOOK INSIDE.
NOW, IN DOING THAT HE HAD TO PASS RIGHT BY THE CURB AREA JUST NORTH OF
THE ROCKINGHAM GATE AND WHAT HE NOTICED WHEN HE PULLED TO THAT AREA THAT
WAS RIGHT IN HIS FIELD OF VIEW IS THAT THERE WAS NO CAR PARKED THERE, NO
WHITE FORD BRONCO, AND IT WAS 10:39. THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE WILL
COME BACK TO THAT AGAIN. HE LOOKED DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND HE SAW THAT
THAT LOOKED LIKE A TIGHTER TURN EVEN THAN ASHFORD, SO HE BACKED THE
LIMOUSINE UP ROCKINGHAM AVENUE AND MADE A LEFT TURN ONTO THE ASHFORD
STREET AND PULLED RIGHT UP TO THE ASHFORD GATE. WHEN I SAY HE PULLED
RIGHT UP TO THE ASHFORD GATE, ON THIS PHOTOGRAPH YOU SEE THE ASHFORD
GATE OF THE DEFENDANT'S RESIDENCE. HE ACTUALLY HAD THE GRILLE OF THE CAR
ALMOST TOUCHING THE GATE FACING INWARD TOWARD IT.

*THE COURT:* WHICH PHOTOGRAPH IS THIS?

*MS. CLARK:* I THOUGHT WE GAVE THE COURT --

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* IT IS P-29, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR, SO THE COURT WON'T HAVE TO INQUIRE AFTER EVERY
PHOTOGRAPH, WE HAVE GIVEN A LIST TO THE COURT FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE.

*THE COURT:* WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE THE RECORD, COUNSEL. YOU
SHOULD TELL US WHICH THIS IS. BECAUSE THE CLERK HAS THE LIST. SHE CAN'T
SEE DIRECTLY THE VIDEO, SO YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHICH VIDEO -- WHICH
GRAPHIC YOU ARE USING.

*MS. CLARK:* VERY WELL, YOUR HONOR. I WILL ASK THAT JONATHAN FAIRTLOUGH
BE ALLOWED TO.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. NOW, WHEN ALLAN PARK PULLED BACK TO
THE ASHFORD GATE PARKING UP AGAINST IT FACING INTO THE DRIVEWAY, HE
LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND IT WAS 10:40 P.M. AT THAT POINT -- AT THAT POINT
HE DECIDED TO GO AND RING THE BUZZER. I WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING
ELSE ON THIS SO YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN I SAY RING THE
BUZZER. I'M GESTURING WITH THIS RED LIGHT. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE, THAT
IS THE CALL BOX, (INDICATING), WHERE HE WILL BE PRESSING THE BUZZER, AND
IT RINGS INSIDE THE HOUSE. THE PERSON INSIDE CAN THEN PRESS A BUTTON TO
OPEN THE GATE. AT 10:40 HE BEGAN TO RING THE BUZZER. HE COULD HEAR IT
SOUND, BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER. THERE WERE LIGHTS ON IN THE UPSTAIRS.
ONE LIGHT ON UPSTAIRS. THERE WERE NO LIGHTS ON DOWNSTAIRS. IT SEEMED TO
HIM LIKE NO ONE WAS HOME AND HE WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THAT, SO HE
DECIDED TO PAGE HIS BOSS AND FIND OUT IF PERHAPS THE PLANS HAD CHANGED.
AT 10:43 HE PAGED HIS BOSS. HE WAS THEN WORRIED THAT PERHAPS THE PAGE
DIDN'T GO THROUGH, SO AT 10:49 HE CALLED HIS BOSS AT HOME, BUT THERE WAS
NO ANSWER. HE THEN GOT OUT AND PUSHED THE BUZZER AT THE ASHFORD GATE A
FEW MORE TIMES. STILL GOT NO ANSWER. NOW, DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME
KATO IS STILL IN HIS ROOM ON THE PHONE WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND RACHEL. NOW,
WHAT I HAVEN'T EXPLAINED TO YOU YET, THIS AREA HERE SHOWN, (INDICATING),
THIS IS THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE DEFENDANT'S PROPERTY. THIS IS A
WALKWAY HERE, BUT IT IS NOT LIKE A WALK, IT IS VERY NARROW AND IT IS
VERY DARK, JUST A FEW FEET WIDE. IT IS COVERED WITH LEAVES AND IT HAS
THE SHRUBBERY THAT IS INDICATED HERE IS ACTUALLY FROM THE NEIGHBOR'S
YARD AND THERE IS A CHAINLINK FENCE AND THE SHRUBBERY IS RIGHT UP
AGAINST IT AND IT OVERHANGS THE WALK TO MAKE IT VERY DARK. HERE YOU CAN
SEE WHAT IS INDICATED AS AN AIR CONDITIONER, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ALL
READ IT, BUT THAT IS WHAT IS WRITTEN HERE, THIS LITTLE BLACK BOX HERE.
THIS AIR CONDITIONER ACTUALLY HANGS OVER THE WALKWAY QUITE A BIT. IT IS
AN AIR CONDITIONER THAT IS SET INTO KATO'S WALL, SO YOU CAN SEE THE AIR
CONDITIONER ON THE INSIDE AND THEN IT HANGS OUTSIDE THE WALL, OUTSIDE
THE HOUSE OVER THAT WALKWAY, SO THAT THIS WALL OF KATO'S ROOM FACES ONTO
THE SOUTH WALKWAY. THERE IS NO ENTRY OR EXIT THERE. HE CAN'T GO OUT THAT
WAY. IF HE WANTS TO EXIT HIS ROOM HE HAS TO EXIT THROUGH THE DOORS THAT
ARE RIGHT HERE, LIKE SHUTTERED DOORS, LIKE SHUTTERS, DOOR-LIKE SHUTTERS,
AND HE GOES OUT THROUGH THOSE SHUTTERED DOORS TO THE POOL AREA AND THAT
IS HOW HE EXITS. SO ON THAT NIGHT HE IS ON THE PHONE WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND
RACHEL.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* OKAY. WHAT IS INDICATED HERE --

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-4.

*MS. CLARK:* WHAT IS INDICATED HERE IS THE AREA I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED TO
YOU. YOU SEE THE SHRUBBERY FROM THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD AND THE CHAINLINK
FENCE AND THIS IS THE AIR CONDITIONER RIGHT HERE THAT I'M CIRCLING. THAT
AIR CONDITIONER IS TO KATO'S ROOM AND IT IS SET INTO THE WALL. YOU CAN
SEE HOW DARK AND NARROW IT IS. THIS IS A SHOT TAKEN DURING THE DAYTIME.
AT 10:45 KATO IS TALKING TO HIS GIRLFRIEND RACHEL WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD
ON THE WALL WHERE THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS THREE LOUD THUMPS. THE THUMPS
WERE SO LOUD THAT A PICTURE ON THAT WALL ACTUALLY MOVED. KATO WAS
ALARMED. HE ASKED RACHEL, "HAVE WE HAD AN EARTHQUAKE?" WHEN SHE SAID SHE
HADN'T FELT ANY, HE BECAME EVEN MORE ALARMED AND THEN HE WONDERED IF
THERE MIGHT BE A PROWLER, SOMEBODY TRYING TO BREAK IN, BECAUSE IF IT
WASN'T AN EARTHQUAKE, THAT IS WHAT IT HAD TO BE. HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT
THE SOUND HE HAD HEARD. HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THOSE THUMPING NOISES AND
SO HE DECIDED THAT EVEN THOUGH HE WAS AFRAID AND IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT
AND DARK HE SHOULD GO AND SEE WHAT THE CAUSES OF THOSE NOISES MIGHT BE.
A FEW MINUTES LATER HE HUNG UP WITH RACHEL AND WENT OUT OF HIS ROOM TO
GO AND LOOK.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-6.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS A PICTURE OF KATO'S ROOM. RIGHT UP HERE WHERE I'M
INDICATING, THAT IS THE AIR CONDITIONER IN THE WALL. THE PART OF THE
WALL THAT YOU CAN'T SEE IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH, WHICH WOULD BE ACTUALLY OVER
HERE, (INDICATING), THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BED, IS WHERE THE PICTURE
WAS HANGING THAT MOVED WHEN THE THUMPS WERE MADE. AND NOW, THE SHUTTERED
DOORS I REFERRED TO, YOU CAN SEE THEM HERE AT THE LEFT EDGE OF THIS
PHOTOGRAPH. YOU SEE THEM BETTER HERE. THIS IS TAKEN FROM THE HEAD OF THE
BED FACING OUTWARD. THESE ARE THE SHUTTERED DOORS THAT LEAD OUT TO THE
POOL AREA.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-5.

*MS. CLARK:* HE WALKED OUT OF THOSE SHUTTERED DOORS AND OUT THROUGH THE
POOL AREA COMING OUT ONTO THE SIDE DOOR THAT BORDERS ASHFORD STREET.
WHEN HE CAME OUT TO THAT SIDE YARD HE SAW THE LIMOUSINE THAT WAS PULLED
UP TO THE ASHFORD GATE, BUT HE FIGURED THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD ALREADY
MADE CONTACT WITH HIM, WAS ABOUT TO LET HIM IN ANYWAY AND DIDN'T PAY ANY
FURTHER ATTENTION, BECAUSE HE WAS VERY DISTRACTED BY WHAT THE CAUSE OF
THOSE NOISES MIGHT BE. NOW, WITH HIM HE HAD A LITTLE DIM FLASHLIGHT THAT
HE WAS GOING TO USE TO TRY AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON BACK THERE IN THE
DARK. IN THE MEANTIME, JUST BEFORE KATO CAME OUT ONTO THE SIDE YARD,
ALLAN PARK WAS STANDING AT THE ASHFORD GATE RINGING THE BUZZER, STILL
GETTING NO ANSWER. FINALLY HE HEARD THE CAR PHONE RINGING INSIDE HIS CAR
AND IT WAS 10:52. HE HAD STILL RECEIVED NO ANSWER TO THE BUZZING AT THE
ASHFORD GATE, GOT BACK INTO THE CAR AND SPOKE TO HIS BOSS, TELLING HIS
BOSS "I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS HOME. WHAT SHALL I DO?" HIS BOSS TOLD HIM
TO WAIT A LITTLE LONGER. AND WHEN HE HAD BEEN SPEAKING TO HIS BOSS FOR
THREE MINUTES HE SAW KATO COMING OUT THE SIDE YARD WITH HIS LITTLE
FLASHLIGHT. ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY SEEING KATO IN THE SIDE YARD, HE SAW A
PERSON SIX FOOT TALL, 200 POUNDS, WEARING ALL DARK CLOTHING, AFRICAN
AMERICAN, WALK QUICKLY UP THE DRIVEWAY AND INTO THE FRONT DOOR ENTRANCE.
IMMEDIATELY AS THAT PERSON ENTERED THE HOUSE THE DOWNSTAIRS LIGHTS WENT
ON. ALLAN PARK HUNG UP THE PHONE AND WALKED OVER TO THE ASHFORD GATE AND
BUZZED AGAIN. THIS TIME HE GOT AN ANSWER AND THE DEFENDANT SAID -- A
VOICE SAID -- THAT ALLAN COULD RECOGNIZE AS THE DEFENDANT'S, THE
DEFENDANT SAID, "SORRY, I OVERSLEPT. I JUST GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER. I
WILL BE DOWN IN ONE MINUTE." NOW, KATO WHO WAS DISTRACTED BY THE
POSSIBILITY OF A PROWLER, WASN'T LOOKING TO SEE IF ANYONE WAS COMING AND
DIDN'T SEE, AND ALTHOUGH ALLAN PARK COULD NOT SEE WELL ENOUGH AT THE
TIME THE PERSON ENTERED THE HOUSE TO IDENTIFY WHO IT WAS, CLEARLY THAT
WAS THE DEFENDANT. NOW, WHILE ALLAN WAS STANDING AT THE GATE SPEAKING TO
THE DEFENDANT ON THE INTERCOM, KATO DECIDED TO WALK AROUND TO THE SOUTH
SIDE OF THE GARAGE AND HE WAS GOING TO ATTEMPT TO GO DOWN THAT NARROW
WALKWAY TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED, BUT WHEN HE ACTUALLY GOT BACK TO THIS
CORNER OF THE GARAGE WITH THIS LITTLE DIM FLASHLIGHT, IT WAS VERY DARK
AND HE WAS SCARED SO HE DECIDED NOT DO AND HE CAME BACK AROUND. WHEN HE
CAME BACK AROUND HE REALIZED THAT THE LIMO DRIVER WAS STILL OUTSIDE THE
GATE, SO EVEN THOUGH THE DEFENDANT HAD SPOKEN TO HIM AND SAID HE WAS
COMING DOWN, HE DID NOT OPEN THE GATE FOR HIM. KATO HAD TO GO AND OPEN
THE GATE. HE OPENED THE GATE AND HE LET HIM PULL IN. AS SOON AS ALLAN
PARK PULLED THE LIMOUSINE INTO THE DRIVEWAY, KATO, WHO WAS STILL VERY
WORRIED ABOUT THE SOUNDS, STARTED TALKING TO HIM, TELLING HIM HE HAD
HEARD THE THUMPS ON HIS WALL, HIS PICTURE MOVED, HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
A PROWLER OR MAYBE IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE, HAD ALLAN FELT AN EARTHQUAKE.
ALLEN SAID, "NO, I HAVEN'T." KATO WAS VERY NERVOUS, BUT NOW WITH ALLAN
PULLED INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND INSIDE THE GROUNDS, HE FELT A LITTLE SAFER,
SO KATO DECIDED TO GO BACK TO THE AREA AND TRY AND CHECK OUT THE SOUNDS
AND WHAT HAD CAUSED THEM. WHEN HE WENT BACK TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE
GARAGE, HE WENT THROUGH A FIRST GATE THAT BASICALLY YOU JUST LIFT AND
PUSH AGAINST THE WALL, IT IS NOT A LOCKING GATE, WENT UP AS FAR AS A
SECOND GATE, BUT COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING. IT WAS STILL DARK, THE
FLASHLIGHT WAS VERY DIM AND HE DECIDED TO COME BACK. HE WAS STILL TOO
AFRAID TO GO BACK THERE BY HIMSELF. KATO CAME BACK OUT AROUND THE
GARAGE, AND WHEN HE CAME OUT HE SAW THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD COME OUT OF
THE HOUSE BY THAT TIME. THE DEFENDANT WAS NOW WEARING A LIGHT BLUE DENIM
SHIRT AND LIGHT BLUE DENIM JEANS. AS HE CAME OUT KATO ALSO NOTICED THAT
THERE WAS A SMALL DARK BAG PLACED NEAR WHERE THE ROLLS ROYCE -- EXCUSE
ME -- THE BENTLEY WAS PARKED. REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THE DEFENDANT PARKED
HIS BENTLEY THIS WAY, (INDICATING), FACING OUT TOWARD ROCKINGHAM. HE
COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A SMALL DARK BAG ON THE GRASS NEAR THAT
BENTLEY. WHILE THEY WERE -- IT WAS ALLAN PARK AND KATO WHO WERE LOADING
ALL OF THE BAGS INTO THE LIMOUSINE, AND WHILE THEY WERE LOADING THE BAGS
INTO THE LIMOUSINE KATO SPOKE AGAIN OF THE THUMPS THAT HE HAD HEARD, AND
BEING WORRIED THAT IT WAS A PROWLER, THINKING IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN
EARTHQUAKE, HOPING IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE, SO HE ASKED THE DEFENDANT FOR A
BETTER FLASHLIGHT SO HE COULD GO AROUND TO THE BACK AREA AND CHECK OUT
THE SOURCE OF THOSE SOUNDS AGAIN. HE AND THE DEFENDANT THEN WALKED INTO
THE HOUSE VERY BRIEFLY, BUT THEN THE DEFENDANT SAID, "OH, IT IS LATE, I
GOT TO GO" AND CAME BACK OUT. WHILE THEY WERE LOADING THE BAGS KATO
OFFERED TO GO AND GET THAT SMALL DARK BAG ON THE GRASS AND PUT IT IN THE
CAR FOR THE DEFENDANT. UNLIKE ANY OF THE OTHER BAGS, THE DEFENDANT SAID,
"NO, NO, NO, I WILL GO GET THEM." HE WENT AND GOT THE BAG. THE DEFENDANT
GOT THE BAG, AND PUT IT INTO THE CAR. NOW, THE DEFENDANT DID NOT GIVE
KATO A BETTER FLASHLIGHT, AND WHEN HE LEFT, ALTHOUGH KATO STILL SEEMED
CONCERNED ABOUT THE THUMPS, THE DEFENDANT SEEMED RELATIVELY UNCONCERNED.
HE GOT INTO THE LIMOUSINE AND THEY LEFT FOR THE AIRPORT AT APPROXIMATELY
11:15.

NOW, LET ME BACK UP FOR A MINUTE. JUST BEFORE HE LEFT, THE DEFENDANT
ASKED KATO TO SET THE ALARM. KATO SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT. HE HAD
NEVER SET THE ALARM BEFORE. HE DIDN'T KNOW THE CODE AND HE FELT VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY. HE TOLD THE DEFENDANT, "NO, I
REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT." THE DEFENDANT THEN LEFT. THEY TOOK OUT --
THEY LEFT AT THE ROCKINGHAM GATE AT 11:15. KATO WENT BACK TO HIS ROOM TO
CALL BACK HIS GIRLFRIEND, RACHEL FERRARA, AS HE PROMISED TO DO. ON THE
WAY TO THE AIRPORT THE DEFENDANT REPEATEDLY COMPLAINED OF BEING HOT.
ALLAN PARK COULD SEE THAT HE WAS SWEATING AND HE ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOWS
AND TURNED ON THE AIR CONDITIONER. THE TEMPERATURE THAT NIGHT WAS 63
DEGREES. DURING THAT DRIVE TO THE AIRPORT ALLAN COULD SEE THAT THE
DEFENDANT WAS MOVING AROUND WITH HIS BAGS IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT,
ALTHOUGH HE COULDN'T SEE EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING. THEY ARRIVED AT THE
AIRPORT AT 11:30 AND THAT SMALL DARK BAG THAT THE DEFENDANT INSISTED ON
PUTTING IN THE CAR HIMSELF WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN AFTER THE DEFENDANT LEFT
FOR CHICAGO. NOW, DURING THE TIME THE DEFENDANT WAS DRIVING TO THE
AIRPORT KATO WAS ON THE PHONE AGAIN WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND RACHEL. DURING
THAT PHONE CALL THERE WAS A CALL WAITING INTERRUPTION. THE CALL WAS
INTERRUPTED BY THE DEFENDANT. THE DEFENDANT TOLD HIM, "I NEED YOU TO SET
THE ALARM. I FORGOT TO SET THE ALARM." HE HAD TO GIVE KATO THE SECURITY
CODE AND TELL HIM WHERE TO GO AND SET THE ALARM. THERE WAS A KEY PAD
OUTSIDE THE FRONT ENTRANCE AT THE FRONT DOOR. NOW, IN THE SIX MONTHS
THAT KATO HAD BEEN LIVING THERE, THE DEFENDANT HAD NEVER ASKED HIM TO
SET THE ALARM BEFORE, HAD NEVER HAD TO GIVE HIM THE SECURITY CODE
BEFORE. THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED. NOW, AT
THIS POINT WE KNOW THE FOLLOWING: WE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THE TIMING AGAIN.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MS. CLARK:* KATO LAST SAW THE DEFENDANT AT 9:35 AS HE WAS STANDING BY
THAT BLACK BENTLEY AFTER THEY HAD COME BACK FROM MC DONALD'S. FORTY
MINUTES LATER, AT 10:15, WE HEAR NICOLE'S DOG BARKING THAT LOUD
INSISTENT BARK THAT WENT ON AND ON AND ON, AND IT WOULD BE SAFE TO
ASSUME THAT IT WAS VERY SHORTLY WITHIN THAT PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE
MURDERS OCCURRED. WHEN ALLAN PARK DROVE OVER TO ROCKINGHAM AND SAW THAT
THE DEFENDANT'S BRONCO WAS NOT THERE AT THE ROCKINGHAM GATE, IT WAS
10:39, AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD NOT YET RETURNED HOME. THE
DRIVE TO ROCK -- BETWEEN ROCKINGHAM AND BUNDY WAS TIMED. TAKING A NORMAL
RATE OF SPEED BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 9:30 AND 10:30 AT NIGHT IT TOOK
APPROXIMATELY SIX MINUTES, AND JUST SO YOU CAN SEE THE RELATIONSHIP OF
THE TWO LOCATIONS, HERE IS NICOLE'S CONDOMINIUM, 875 SOUTH BUNDY, HERE
IS THE DEFENDANT'S RESIDENCE, 360 NORTH ROCKINGHAM. (INDICATING).

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. FOR THE RECORD, THIS IS A BLOW-UP OF A THOMAS
BROTHERS MAP?

*MS. CLARK:* YES, MAP OF BRENTWOOD AREA.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. CLARK:* SO AT 9:35, LAST SIGHT OF THE DEFENDANT. FORTY MINUTES
LATER AT 10:15 THE DOG IS BARKING, NICOLE'S DOG IS BARKING. AT 10:45,
HALF AN HOUR LATER, WE HEAR THE THUMPS ON THE WALL. THIS LEAVES US
BETWEEN 9:35 AND 10:45 FOR THE DEFENDANT TO DRIVE FROM ROCKINGHAM TO
BUNDY AND BACK, A TOTAL OF TWELVE MINUTES, WHICH LEAVES HIM A FULL HOUR
TO COMMIT THE MURDERS. NOW, LET'S GO BACK TO NICOLE'S HOME AT 875 SOUTH
BUNDY. NOW, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT SUKRU BOZTEPE SAW WHEN NICOLE'S
DOG TOOK HIM TO 875 SOUTH BUNDY.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-7.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS THE VIEW FROM THE WALKWAY. THIS IS FROM THE
SIDEWALK AREA AT THE END OF THE WALKWAY AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS. YOU
SEE THE BODY OF NICOLE. SHE IS WEARING THE BLACK DRESS THAT SHE WORE AT
THE MEZZALUNA THAT NIGHT. OFFICERS RISKI AND TERRAZAS WERE THE FIRST
OFFICERS TO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE. THEY GOT THERE AT 12:13. THAT IS 12:13
A.M., SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. THEY IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED MR. BOZTEPE AND
HIS WIFE WHO POINTED TO WHERE THEY HAD SEEN NICOLE. WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS
WHAT OFFICERS RISKI AND TERRAZAS SAW WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE SCENE. YOU
CAN SEE HEAR THE PAW PRINTS --

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-8.

*MS. CLARK:* -- OF A DOG. OFFICER RISKI WILL DESCRIBE TO YOU WHAT IT WAS
HE SAW WHEN HE GOT THERE. THEY WERE THE SAME PAW PRINTS, NO SHOEPRINT,
ONLY DOG PRINTS UP AND DOWN THIS WALKWAY. IN ORDER NOT TO DISTURB THE
BLOOD OR ANY OF THE EVIDENCE, OFFICER RISKI AND TERRAZAS WALKED UP THE
SIDE WHERE YOU SEE THE BUSHES NEXT TO THE WALKWAY.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-10.

*MS. CLARK:* THEY WALKED ALONGSIDE, IT WOULD BE TO THE LEFT SIDE.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK, IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME JUST A MOMENT, BEFORE YOU
BRING UP THE NEXT ONE AND LET ME KNOW WHAT IT IS, BECAUSE I INDICATED TO
YOU I DO NOT WANT TO LET OUT A VIDEO FEED OF CERTAIN ITEMS.

*MS. CLARK:* RIGHT, RIGHT.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU.

*MS. CLARK:* OFFICER RISKI WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE END OF THE WALKWAY
IN THE BUSHES TO WHERE -- TO A POINT WHERE HE WAS ABLE TO SEE AT THAT
POINT THAT IT WAS NOT JUST NICOLE, BUT ALSO RON. YOUR HONOR --

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MS. CLARK:* -- THIS ONE.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-11.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU. YOU SEE HERE RON GOLDMAN AS HE WAS FOUND BY
OFFICERS RISKI AND TERRAZAS. NOW, WHAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
SEE IN THESE PHOTOGRAPHS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS THE FACT THAT NICOLE
BROWN'S THROAT WAS HIDEOUSLY SLASHED, AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE AND
THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT HER MURDER TOOK VERY LITTLE TIME TO
ACCOMPLISH. THE SAME GOES FOR RON GOLDMAN. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHAT YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IN THIS CASE, BUT I WILL DESCRIBE TO YOU NOW, IS THE
AREA IN WHICH HE WAS CONFRONTED, THE AREA IN WHICH HE WAS SUDDENLY
ATTACKED BY THIS DEFENDANT, IT WAS VERY SMALL. HE WAS LITERALLY BACKED
INTO A CAGE WHERE HE HAD NOWHERE TO RUN AND THAT IS HOW HIS MURDER WAS
ACCOMPLISHED IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. YOU CAN SEE THE AREA HE IS
IN RIGHT THERE. WHAT YOU CAN'T TELL FROM THESE PHOTOGRAPHS IS HOW SMALL,
HOW NARROW THIS AREA REALLY IS. IT IS VERY SMALL. HE'S BORDERED ON ONE
SIDE BY THE RUNGS, YOU CAN SEE BY THE FENCE, AND BY THE OTHER AT HIS
FEET, YET ANOTHER FENCE. HE IS LITERALLY, LITERALLY BACKED INTO A
CORNER. NOW, SO YOU CAN SEE THE RELATIONSHIP AND HOW CLOSE NICOLE AND
RON ACTUALLY WERE, I HAVE A DIAGRAM.

*THE COURT:* CAN WE TAKE THE PICTURE DOWN?

*MS. CLARK:* YES. WHAT THIS BOARD SHOWS YOU -- AND THIS IS A BOARD, YOUR
HONOR, CALLED 875 SOUTH BUNDY DRIVE, DEPICTING ENVELOPE, HAT, GLOVE AND
BOTH OF THE VICTIMS -- WHAT THIS SHOWS YOU IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE --

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, MAY I SEE YOU AT THE SIDE BAR, PLEASE, WITH THE
REPORTER?

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD AT THE BENCH:)

*THE COURT:* WE ARE AT THE SIDE BAR. MISS CLARK, I EXPRESSED TO YOU MY
DESIRE NOT TO PUBLICLY DISPLAY THE BODY OF THE VICTIM SO THAT THE NEWS
MEDIA WOULD GET PICTURES OF THEM SO IT WOULD BE ON THE FRONT OF THE
NATIONAL ENQUIRER LATER THIS WEEK, AND THE TELEVISION CAMERA WAS FOCUSED
IN ON THOSE SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS ON THERE AND YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME ENOUGH
WARNING TO TELL ME WHAT IT WAS SO I COULD CUT THAT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* JUDGE, YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE THIS.

*MS. CLARK:* I'M SORRY.

*MR. COCHRAN:* CAN YOU SEE THIS ONE? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE ONE THAT
IS UP THERE ALREADY?

*THE COURT:* NO, THE -- FIRST OF ALL, THE CHART THAT YOU HAVE UP HAS
PHOTOGRAPHS --

*MR. SHAPIRO:* A PHOTOGRAPH ON THERE.

*THE COURT:* -- OF THE VICTIMS LYING IN THESE POOLS OF BLOOD RESPECTIVELY.

*MS. CLARK:* RIGHT.

*THE COURT:* YOU CAN'T GIVE ME ENOUGH TIME TO TELL WHAT IT WAS SO I
COULD CUT THE VIDEO FEED.

*MS. CLARK:* I'M SORRY.

*THE COURT:* AND THE PROBLEM IS, THEY CAN ZOOM IN ON THOSE THINGS AND
BLOW THEM UP AND NOW THEY'VE GOT THEM, SO I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO GIVE ME
A LITTLE MORE HEADS UP BEFORE YOU DO THAT SO I CAN CUT THE CAMERA.

*MS. CLARK:* YEAH.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. AS SOON AS I SAW WHAT IT WAS, I CUT THE CAMERA,
BUT I THINK IT IS TOO LATE BECAUSE THEY ONLY NEED THREE SECONDS.

*MS. CLARK:* I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR. IT IS A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

*THE COURT:* I KNOW, BUT PLEASE.

*MS. CLARK:* I AGREE. I AGREE. WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

*THE COURT:* WELL, WE LOST IT. IT IS GONE. I MEAN, I CAN'T STOP IT. YOU
KNOW, 186,000 MINUTES PER SECOND. I MEAN IT IS GONE. BUT JUST LET ME
KNOW IF SOMETHING ELSE IS COMING UP.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT IS IT. I WILL JUST TELL YOU THIS BOARD I'M GOING TO
USE, AND IF I PICK IT UP AGAIN I WILL SAY I'M GOING TO PICK IT UP AGAIN.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. I HAVE CUT BOTH FEEDS.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO CONVEY TO YOU
HERE IS THE SMALLNESS OF THE AREA IN WHICH THE VICTIMS WERE ATTACKED. IT
LEFT THEM NOWHERE TO GO, ESPECIALLY RON, WHO IS LITERALLY WEDGED INTO A
CORNER. NICOLE IS JUST A FEW FEET FROM HIM AND BETWEEN THEM YOU WILL SEE
THE EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT. WHAT YOU SEE HERE IN ITEM
P, THIS PHOTOGRAPH, THAT IS THE ENVELOPE IN WHICH JUDITHA BROWN'S
CLASSES WERE KEPT THAT WERE PUT IN THERE BY KAREN CRAWFORD, THE BAR
MANAGER, AND RON GOLDMAN TOOK THEM WITH HIM TO GIVE TO NICOLE. HERE
UNDER THE PLANT, WHICH IS AT THE FOOT OF RON GOLDMAN, PARTIALLY HIDDEN
BY THE PLANT, IS THE BLUE SKI CAP, THE BLUE LEATHER GLOVE. THIS IS
NICOLE AND THIS IS THE BODY OF RON GOLDMAN, (INDICATING).

*THE COURT:* I HAVE TURNED BOTH SYSTEMS BACK ON.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. YOUR HONOR, WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO
THE SCREEN AND IT IS GOING TO BE A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPH.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-12.

*MS. CLARK:* ALL RIGHT. THIS IS A VIEW LOOKING FROM UP TO DOWN. WE DID
WARN YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT THIS WAS A CASE THAT WAS GOING TO
HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WOULD BE VERY, VERY HARD TO LOOK AT. WE HAVE TO
SHOW YOU THE EVIDENCE, AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE GRAPHIC NATURE OF THEM,
BUT THIS IS THE CRIME THAT WE ARE HERE TO EXAMINE. LOOKING DOWN THE
STEPS, WHAT THE OFFICER IS POINTING TO IS A SKI CAP, THE GLOVE THAT I
HAVE JUST SHOWN YOU IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS. YOU CAN SEE IT NOW IN RELATION
TO NICOLE. AT THE TOP OF THE PHOTOGRAPH YOU CAN JUST SEE THE BOOT OF RON
GOLDMAN AND YOU CAN SEE THE ENVELOPE IN BETWEEN THEM. THAT IS THE SCENE
AS IT WAS FOUND BY OFFICERS RISKI AND TERRAZAS.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-13.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS A CLOSE-UP. YOU CAN SEE NOW UNDERNEATH THE PLANT.
IT WAS HARDER SEE BEFORE FROM A DISTANCE, THE GLOVE AND THE SKI CAP.
WHAT YOU CAN ALSO SEE HERE IS THE BLOODY SHOEPRINT. WE WILL BE SHOWING
YOU MORE OF THOSE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS CLARK, I'M GOING TO RELEASE THIS ONE VIDEO.

*MS. CLARK:* OKAY.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-14.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS A LITTLE BIT CLOSER SHOT TO LET YOU SEE HOW CLEARLY
YOU SEE THE BLOODY SHOEPRINT AT THE SCENE, RIGHT AT THE -- RIGHT NEAR
THE SKI CAP, THE GLOVE, AND YOU CAN SEE HOW ON A DARK NIGHT WHEN IT IS
DARK THERE, A SKI CAP, THE GLOVE WOULD BE HIDDEN BY THE PLANT, IT WOULD
BE DIFFICULT TO FIND, AND UNDER PRESSURE AND HURRIED SITUATION YOU ARE
NOT GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO LOOK FOR THEM. UPON SEEING WHAT YOU
HAVE JUST SEEN HERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, OFFICER RISKI WENT AND
NOTIFIED HIS SUPERVISOR WHO ARRIVED AT 12:30. A CRIME SCENE WAS
IMMEDIATELY SET UP, YELLOW TAPE WAS PLACED IN FRONT OF THE RESIDENCE AND
BEHIND THE RESIDENCE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE WOULD WALK IN AND
DISTURB ANY OF THE EVIDENCE. AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SUPERVISOR,
OFFICER RISKI ENTERED THE CONDOMINIUM. NOW, WHAT I SHOULD TELL YOU IS
THAT WHEN HE CAME TO THE SCENE HE FOUND THE BODY OF NICOLE. HE COULD SEE
THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CONDO AND IT WAS STANDING WIDE OPEN, SO SHE HAD
JUST COME OUTSIDE WHEN SHE WAS ATTACKED.

HE WENT INSIDE THINKING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SUSPECT INSIDE AND LOOKED
ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE. NOT ONLY DID HE NOT FIND A SUSPECT, BUT HE FOUND
NO EVIDENCE OF RANSACKING, NO EVIDENCE OF FORCED ENTRY, NO EVIDENCE OF A
STRUGGLE, NOTHING THAT WOULD INDICATE THIS WAS RELATED IN ANY WAY TO A
BURGLARY. WHEN HE GOT UPSTAIRS IN THAT CONDO HE FOUND THE TWO CHILDREN,
JUSTIN AND SYDNEY, ASLEEP IN THEIR BED. THEY WERE TAKEN QUICKLY OUT OF
THE CONDO OUT THROUGH THE REAR TO AVOID THE HIDEOUS SIGHT IN FRONT OF
THEIR HOUSE. NOW, WHEN OFFICER RISKI SAW -- HE HAD GONE INSIDE TO CLEAR
THE HOUSE, HE CAME OUT THE FRONT DOOR AND HE LOOKED DOWN THE WALK, AND I
WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU NOW WHAT HE SAW ON THAT BE WALKWAY.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P- --

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR, THIS IS -- CAN YOU KILL THIS ONE?

*THE COURT:* I'M GOING TO TURN IT OFF UNTIL I SEE SOMETHING.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-15.

*MS. CLARK:* WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU HERE IS A SHOEPRINT AGAIN RIGHT HERE,
HEEL PRINT, A BLOODY HEEL PRINT, AND ANOTHER ONE HERE, (INDICATING). NEXT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-16.

*MS. CLARK:* AGAIN BLOODY SHOEPRINTS. YOU CAN SEE ONE SET OF BLOODY
SHOEPRINTS AS THEY GO DOWN THE WALKWAY.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. I AM RELEASING THIS ONE.

*MS. CLARK:* ALL RIGHT. THOSE BLOODY SHOEPRINTS, THAT ONE SET OF BLOODY
SHOEPRINTS CONTINUE ALL THE WAY BACK TOWARD THE REAR ALLEY AREA WHERE
THERE IS THE DRIVEWAY. REMEMBER I SHOWED YOU EARLIER ON THAT THERE WAS A
DRIVEWAY AREA BEHIND THE CONDOMINIUM WHERE HER JEEP WAS PARKED. THESE
BLOODY SHOEPRINTS ARE ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION LEAVING THE BODIES OF
RON AND NICOLE GOING TOWARD THE BACK AREA.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-17.

*MS. CLARK:* AND YOU CAN SEE THEM HERE AGAIN IN A PERSPECTIVE SHOT. I'M
CIRCLING WITH THE RED PEN. ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE WALKWAY THEY START TO
FADE OUT AS THE BLOOD IS PICKED UP BY THE SIDEWALK. WHAT OFFICER RISKI
ALSO SAW WERE THAT THERE WERE BLOOD DROPS JUST TO THE LEFT OF THOSE
BLOODY SHOEPRINTS, SO NEXT TO THAT SINGLE SET OF BLOODY SHOEPRINTS
LEAVING THE SCENE YOU HAD BLOOD DROPS TO THE LEFT OF THEM.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-18.

*MS. CLARK:* THESE MARKERS HERE INDICATE WHERE THERE WERE BLOOD DROPS
FOUND AND CLOSE UP.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-19.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT IS A CLOSE-UP OF 112 THAT YOU SAW FARTHER IN THE
DISTANCE, THE BLOOD DROP.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-18 AGAIN.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT GIVES YOU THE PERSPECTIVE. NOW I CAN SHOW YOU WHAT I
WAS TALKING ABOUT. HERE IS A BLOODY SHOEPRINT. TO THE LEFT BLOOD DROP.
OFF FARTHER, SEE THIS ONE I'M CIRCLING HERE CLOSE UP.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-21.

*MS. CLARK:* ANOTHER BLOOD DROP. YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS TO THE LEFT
AGAIN OF A BLOODY SHOEPRINT. THAT IS A HEEL YOU ARE LOOKING AT THERE.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-22.

*MS. CLARK:* AGAIN THIS IS SHOWING YOU ANOTHER BLOOD DROP THAT WAS FOUND
GOING DOWN THE STAIRS. I SHOULD EXPLAIN TO YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THAT THE WALKWAY GOING FROM THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE TO THE REAR HAS MANY
STAIRS GOING UP AND DOWN, SO THERE ARE LANDINGS GOING UP AND DOWN, SO
YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF STAIRS ON THIS PATHWAY AND ON THE STAIRS AS WELL
I'M CIRCLING HERE, THAT IS A BLOOD DROP. THERE WERE ALSO BLOODY
SHOEPRINTS SEEN HERE. I THINK YOU CAN EVEN SEE THIS ONE I'M CIRCLING
WITH THE PEN RIGHT NOW.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-2.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT IS CLOSE UP, THE ONE ON THE STAIRS, BLOOD DROP.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-24.

*MS. CLARK:* AGAIN NOW, THIS IS AT THE REAR GATE OF THE CONDO. THIS TAG
SHOWS ANOTHER BLOOD DROP THAT WAS FOUND CLOSE UP.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-25.

*MS. CLARK:* AND THERE IT IS AND NOW THE BLOOD DROPS CONTINUED OUT TO
THE DRIVEWAY AREA.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-26.

*MS. CLARK:* THESE MARKERS SHOW CLOSE UP.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-27.

*MS. CLARK:* YOU SEE HERE THE BLOOD DROP ON THE DRIVEWAY. NOW, THE
SHOEPRINTS THAT YOU SAW WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY A SIZE 12
SHOE. THE DEFENDANT WEARS A SIZE 12. THE BLOOD DROPS TO THE LEFT OF THE
BLOODY SHOEPRINTS, WHEN THE DEFENDANT RETURNED HOME FROM CHICAGO, HE WAS
FOUND TO HAVE HAD A CUT TO THE MIDDLE FINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-35.

*MS. CLARK:* THE CASE WAS ASSIGNED TO THE ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION,
DETECTIVES PHILIP VANNATTER AND TOM LANGE, THE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS
ASSIGNED TO HANDLE THE CASE. THEY ARRIVED AT THE SCENE JUST AFTER 4:00
A.M. AND THEN VIEWED THE CRIME SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AS I HAVE JUST
DESCRIBED IT TO YOU. THEY FOUND THE SAME THINGS THAT OFFICER RISKI
FOUND. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE WERE TWO YOUNG CHILDREN BEING HELD AT
THE STATION PENDING SOME ADULT WHO COULD TAKE CHARGE OF THEM, THEY
DETERMINED THAT THEY WOULD GO AND MAKE NOTIFICATION TO THE DEFENDANT.
THEY THEN PROCEEDED TO THE DEFENDANT'S HOUSE. NOW, THEY GOT TO THE
DEFENDANT'S HOUSE AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 A.M. AT THAT TIME THEY STARTED
TO RING THE ASHFORD GATE AND THEY BUZZED AND THEY BUZZED, BUT THEY GOT
NO ANSWER. NOW AT THAT POINT THEY COULD SEE THERE WERE LIGHTS ON IN THE
HOUSE, THERE WERE CARS IN THE DRIVEWAY, BUT NO ONE WAS ANSWERING. THEY
EVENTUALLY GOT THE DEFENDANT'S HOME PHONE NUMBER, CALLED IT REPEATEDLY,
BUT AGAIN THEY GOT NO ANSWER. THEN THE DETECTIVE SAW THE WHITE FORD
BRONCO PARKED AT THE ROCKINGHAM GATE.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-30.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS THE POSITION IN WHICH THE BRONCO WAS FOUND JUST TO
THE NORTH OF THE ROCKINGHAM GATE AND THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT
HERE. THIS AREA HERE IS THE ROCKINGHAM GATE ENTRANCE TO THE DEFENDANT'S
HOME. THIS IS THE LOCATION THAT ALLAN PARK DROVE BY EARLIER THAT NIGHT
AT 10:39 AND SAW THAT THERE WAS NO BRONCO THERE AT THAT TIME.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-31.

*MS. CLARK:* THE DETECTIVE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A SMALL SPOT OF BLOOD
NEAR THE DRIVER'S HANDLE OF THAT DOOR. THE CRIMINALIST IS POINTING TO IT
HERE. THAT IS DENNIS FUNG.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-32.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT IS A CLOSE-UP. YOU CAN SEE HOW SMALL THAT SPOT OF
BLOOD IS.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-33.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS TAKEN FROM THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-34.

*MS. CLARK:* INSIDE THE VEHICLE. THEY SAW -- IN THE REAR CARGO AREA THEY
WERE ABLE TO SEE A PACKAGE THAT WAS ADDRESSED TO ORENTHAL PRODUCTIONS.
KNOWING THAT THAT WAS THE DEFENDANT'S FIRST NAME, THEY REALIZED THAT
THAT WAS PROBABLY HIS CAR. AFTER ALL THEY HAD SEEN AND FAILING TO BE
ABLE TO GET ANY ANSWER AT THE DEFENDANT'S HOME, THEY BECAME ALARMED AND
THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ENTER THE PROPERTY TO SEE IF THEY COULD LOCATE
SOMEONE OR FIND PERHAPS ANOTHER VICTIM. WHEN THEY WENT IN THEY WENT
FIRST TO KATO'S ROOM. THEY KNOCKED ON HIS DOOR AND THEY ASKED HIM IF
THERE WAS SOMEONE THERE WHO COULD ASSIST THEM. HE DIRECTED THEM TO
ARNELLE WHO WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR. KATO TOLD THE DETECTIVES ABOUT THE LOUD
THUMPS THAT HE HAD HEARD AGAINST THE SOUTH WALL OF HIS RESIDENCE THAT
NIGHT AND AT ABOUT BEING WORRIED ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THOSE NOISES. AFTER
HE TOLD THEM ABOUT THOSE NOISES INDICATING THAT IT WAS ON THE SOUTH WALL
AND IT SEEMED TO COME FROM THE AREA OF HIS AIR CONDITIONER, THE
DETECTIVES WENT OUT TO LOOK TO SEE WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THOSE NOISES.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-36.

*MS. CLARK:* AND THIS IS WHERE THEY WENT, THE SAME AREA THAT KATO HAD
WALKED TO EARLIER BUT NEVER GOTTEN UP TO BECAUSE HE WAS TOO AFRAID, THE
AREA OF THE AIR CONDITIONER. AS THEY APPROACHED THIS AREA, IT WAS VERY
DARK. THEY WERE UNABLE TO SEE ANYTHING UNTIL THEY GOT CLOSER.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-37, P-38.

*MS. CLARK:* AND THERE IS THE GLOVE WHERE IT WAS FOUND IN THE VERY SAME
LOCATION IN WHICH IT WAS FOUND THAT NIGHT RIGHT NEXT TO THE AIR
CONDITIONER ON THAT NARROW PATH. WHEN THEY SAW THAT GLOVE THEY REALIZED
THAT IT LOOKED LIKE THE MATE TO THE GLOVE THAT YOU ALREADY SAW AT THE
BUNDY SEEN UNDERNEATH THE PLANT AT THE FOOT OF THE BODY OF RON GOLDMAN.
THEY THEN REALIZED THAT PERHAPS THEY NEEDED TO SECURE THE RESIDENCE AND
DETECTIVE VANNATTER THEN WALKED OUT OF THIS PATHWAY AND OUT ONTO THE
DRIVEWAY.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-40.

*MS. CLARK:* WHEN HE WALKED OUT ONTO THE DRIVEWAY WHAT DETECTIVE
VANNATTER SAW, NOW THAT IT WAS BECOMING LIGHT, IT WAS AT LEAST SIX
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AT THAT POINT, WERE BLOOD DROPS ON THE DRIVEWAY
THAT LED FROM THE BRONCO AND ALL THE WAY INTO THE HOUSE.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-41.

*MS. CLARK:* AND CLOSE UP.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-42.

*MS. CLARK:* AND THERE IS THE BLOOD DROP, ONE OF THE BLOOD DROPS THAT
WAS SEEN.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-43.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS INSIDE THE HOUSE. THIS IS RIGHT INSIDE THE FRONT
DOOR IN THE FOYER AREA. THERE WERE A SERIES OF THREE BLOOD DROPS HERE
CLOSE UP.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-44.

*MS. CLARK:* YOU CAN SEE THEM HERE. I'M CIRCLING THEM. HAVING SEEN ALL
OF THIS, THE DETECTIVE THEN REALIZED THAT THIS WAS NOT JUST AN OCCASION
TO MAKE NOTIFICATION, THAT IN FACT THEY HAD UNCOVERED EVIDENCE THAT
INDICATED THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD COMMITTED THESE MURDERS. THEY SECURED
THE HOME AND PREPARED TO CONDUCT A SEARCH. CRIMINALIST DENNIS FUNG
ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM AT ABOUT 7:00 A.M. WHERE HE BEGAN TO TEST ALL OF
THE BLOOD DROPS THEY HAD FOUND. HE TESTED THE BRONCO AND THEN HE TESTED
THE DROPS ON THE DRIVEWAY, DETERMINED THAT THE DROPS ON THE DRIVEWAY
WERE INDEED BLOOD, THEN HE WENT TO TEST THE GLOVE AND FOUND THAT IT,
TOO, CONTAINED BLOOD. A SEARCH OF THE HOUSE INSIDE THE HOUSE REVEALED,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, A PAIR OF RUMPLED SOCKS AT THE FOOT OF THE
DEFENDANT'S BED IN HIS BEDROOM.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-45.

*MS. CLARK:* YOU SEE THERE THE SOCK THAT I JUST SPOKE OF. THIS IS
EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE FOUND IN THAT CONDITION.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-46.

*MS. CLARK:* CLOSE UP. THOSE SOCKS WERE COLLECTED, AND ALONG AS WITH
MANY OTHER ITEMS, AND SUBMITTED FOR ANALYSIS. NOW, THE DEFENDANT'S
BRONCO -- THE DEFENDANT'S BRONCO THAT YOU EARLIER SAW ON ROCKINGHAM
PROVED TO BE LOCKED. THEY COULDN'T FIND ANY OPINION KEYS FOR IT, THEY
COULDN'T GET INTO IT, SO IT WAS TOWED IN A LOCKED CONDITION TO THE PRINT
SHED, WHICH IS AN AREA WHERE THE POLICE KEEP LARGE ITEMS THAT NEED TO BE
FINGERPRINTED, WHERE THEY CAN KEEP IT LOCKED UP. THEY TOWED IT TO THE
PRINT SHED AND DID NOT OPEN IT UNTIL THE 14TH WHEN THEY OPENED IT BY USE
OF A SLIMJIM.

YOU WILL PROBABLY HEAR SOME DISCUSSION OF THINGS THAT OCCURRED WITH THAT
BRONCO AFTER THE 15TH AND THEY MAY BE INTERESTING, BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS RECOVERED ON THE 14TH. AND A SEARCH FOR
BLOOD WAS CONDUCTED OF THAT BRONCO ON JUNE THE 14TH. THOSE ITEMS WERE
RECOVERED. THE BLOOD WAS COLLECTED AND IT WAS ANALYZED AND THOSE ITEMS
THAT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THAT WERE ANALYZED WERE RECOVERED
FROM THE BRONCO ON JUNE THE 14TH. NOW, ALL OF THE ITEMS I HAVE JUST
SHOWN YOU WERE COLLECTED AND SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION AND ANALYSIS, AND
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS A TRAIL OF BLOOD FROM BUNDY DRIVE TO ROCKINGHAM
AVENUE AND INTO THE DEFENDANT'S VERY BEDROOM LINKED BY THE DEFENDANT'S
WHITE FORD BRONCO. I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE DETAILS RIGHT NOW WITH
YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH EVIDENCE WAS
COLLECTED OR THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ALL ANALYZED, WE HAVE EXPERTS
FOR THAT, BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS IN ORDER TO POINT
OUT A FEW THINGS RIGHT NOW JUST TO DISPEL ANY MISCONCEPTION ANYONE MIGHT
HAVE ABOUT EVIDENCE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. FIRST OF ALL, COLLECTING
BLOOD STAINS IS A VERY SIMPLE THING, YOU OR I COULD DO IT, AND I TELL
YOU THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT THAT GOOD MECHANICALLY OR SCIENTIFICALLY, BUT
EVEN I COULD DO IT. WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE A VERY SMALL SQUARE OF
COTTON AND YOU PUT DISTILLED WATER ON IT AND YOU SOAK UP THE STAIN.
THERE IS NO MAGIC. ANYONE CAN DO IT. IT IS JUST LIKE YOU WOULD GO AND
SOAK UP A SPILL IN YOUR KITCHEN; NOT VERY DIFFERENT. NOW, MANY
LABORATORIES OR MANY POLICE AGENCIES USE LAB TECHNICIANS FOR THAT, YOU
KNOW, PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A BACHELOR'S OF SCIENCE OR ANY PARTICULAR
DEGREE OF CRIMINALISTICS OR FORENSICS. FORENSICS IS A SCIENCE OF CRIME
ANALYSIS OR INVESTIGATION. MANY OF THEM DON'T USE ANYONE FOR THAT, BUT
LAPD DOES. LAPD USES CRIMINALISTS WHO ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BACHELOR OF
SCIENCE DEGREES IN FORENSIC SCIENCE, THE SCIENCE OF CRIME SCENE
ANALYSIS, SO THEY ACTUALLY USE PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERQUALIFIED FOR THE JOB.
AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE WILL BE THE TESTIMONY OF THE CORONER. I KNOW SOME
OF US HAVE SEEN ANYWAY QUINCY, JACK KLUGMAN ON TELEVISION. HE GOES OUT
TO INVESTIGATE THE CRIME AND HE FINDS OUT WHO DID IT, AND IN THE GENERAL
COURSE OF THINGS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS A CORONER'S INVESTIGATOR, THAT
INVESTIGATOR IS JUST RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING THE BODY FROM THE SCENE
AND GETTING IT TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE INTACT. WHAT THE CORONER DOES IS
THE CORONER LOOKS AT THE BODY TO DETERMINE CAUSE OF DEATH.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I CAN GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING IN THIS TRIAL, THERE
WILL BE NO DISPUTE AS TO CAUSE OF DEATH. NO ONE WILL ARGUE ABOUT WHAT
THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS FOR RON GOLDMAN AND NICOLE BROWN. THE ISSUE THAT
WILL BE RAISED IS THE TIME OF DEATH. NOW, WHAT CAN A CORONER DO FOR YOU
WITH RESPECT TO TIME OF DEATH? THE CORONER CAN NEVER REALLY BE THAT
PRECISE. A CORONER CAN TELL YOU JUST BASED ON HIS EXAMINATION OF THE
BODY, CAN USUALLY BRING IT DOWN TO A RANGE OF WITHIN THREE HOURS,
BETWEEN 9:00 AND MIDNIGHT, BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND 3:00, BUT IF YOU WANT TO
PINPOINT THE TIME TO WITHIN A MINUTE, TEN MINUTES, A HALF HOUR OR EVEN
AN HOUR OR TWO HOURS, A CORONER SOLELY BY HIS EXAMINATION OF THE BODY
CANNOT DO IT. WE ALWAYS HAVE TO -- AND THAT IS TRUE IN ANY CASE, IN ANY
CASE. WE ALWAYS HAVE TO RELY ON THE TESTIMONY OF OTHER WITNESSES,
WITNESSES WHO WILL TELL YOU WHEN THE VICTIMS MADE A PHONE CALL OR WHEN
THEY HEARD THE VICTIM LEAVING THE HOUSE OR WHEN THEY LAST SAW THE
VICTIM. DOGS BARKING, THE KIND OF EVIDENCE I JUST TALKED TO YOU ABOUT,
IS OFTEN WHAT IS USED IF YOU WANT TO TRY AND REALLY PINPOINT THE TIME
BECAUSE THE CORONER CANNOT PINPOINT IT TO WITHIN MINUTES OR EVEN AN HOUR
REALLY INY ANY CASE.

NOW, BEFORE I GET INTO THE ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO
YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT SCIENTISTS AND CRIMINALISTS LOOK FOR
NOWADAYS WHEN THEY EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE. WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES
IN MANY AREAS. IN GENERAL, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE CRIMES, THE
POLICE HAVE TO STAY AT LEAST ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE CRIMINALS. THAT MEANS
THAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE IN PLACES AND IN WAYS THAT CRIMINALS
WILL NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT YOU
COULD MATCH FINGERPRINTS, CRIMINALS WORE GLOVES. WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN
THAT A BULLET REMOVED FROM THE BODY OF A VICTIM COULD BE MATCHED TO THE
GUN THAT FIRED THE BULLET, THEY STARTED TO DISPOSE OF WEAPONS OR TO USE
WEAPONS THAT COULD BE EASILY DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN GUNS, AND NOWADAYS
IT IS VERY COMMON TO FIND CASES WHERE NO MURDER WEAPON IS RECOVERED
BECAUSE THEY ARE SMART ENOUGH TO GET RID OF THOSE WEAPONS. SO NOT ALL
CRIMINALS FIGURED THIS OUT, BUT THE SMART ONES DID, SO WE LOOK AT BLOOD,
FOR EXAMPLE. WE TEST IT FOR DNA. WE LOOK AT HAIR AND FIBER. WE EXAMINE
IT MICROSCOPICALLY COMPARING IT TO THE VICTIMS AND TO THE SUSPECTS TO
SEE IF WE CAN EXCLUDE THEM OR IF IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THEM. NOW, IN
PARTICULAR, THE VALUE OF HAIR AND FIBER IS A VERY UNIQUE THING. THE
REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THROUGH YOUR DAILY LIFE YOU WALK AROUND, YOU
SHED HAIR, YOU SHED FIBER, YOU PICK UP HAIR, YOU PICK UP FIBER, AND YOU
ARE NOT AWARE OF IT, IT GOES UNNOTICED, AND IT IS AN INVOLUNTARY THING
AND IT HAPPENS CONSTANTLY THROUGH THE DAY. THERE IS A VERY FANCY TERM
FOR THIS AND IT IS CALLED THE LOCAR EXCHANGE PRINCIPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE
TO REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE ALL IT REALLY SAYS IS WHEN YOU GO INTO A PLACE
THE ENVIRONMENT AFFECTS YOU AND YOU AFFECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT IS
JUST WHAT I SAID. YOU LEAVE HAIR AND FIBERS AND YOU PICK UP HAIR AND
FIBERS. SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A RED COUCH, AN EXPERT CAN LOOK AT
YOUR CLOTHING AND FIND THE RED FIBERS AND LOOK AT THEM UNDER A
MICROSCOPE AND SAY, FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE NEAR SOMETHING WITH RED
FIBERS, AND IF HE HAS ACCESS WITH THAT COUCH, CAN EXAMINE IT AND SEE
THAT THEY ARE CONSISTENT, THAT IS, THAT THEY COULD HAVE HAD THE SAME
SOURCE. WHAT THE VALUE OF THIS IS THAT IT SHOWS CONTACT, IT SHOWS WHERE
ITEMS OF EVIDENCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN, IT SHOWS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A
GIVEN LOCATION AND WHO CAME INTO CONTACT WITH WHO. BECAUSE YOU FIND HAIR
AND FIBER SO OFTEN IN A CRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE SHEDDING GOES
UNNOTICED, THIS CAN BE A VERY GREAT VALUE IN SOLVING CRIMES. SO EVERY
CRIME SCENE AND EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE HAS VALUE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE
TO HELP YOU SOLVE THE CASE. NOW, WITH RESPECT TO BLOOD EVIDENCE, AS YOU
KNOW, WE'VE MADE ENORMOUS STRIDES. WE HAVE ADVANCED OUR ABILITY TO
EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM BLOOD WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF DNA TESTING. THIS
ALLOWS US TO BE FAR MORE PRECISE IN PINPOINTING THE POSSIBLE SOURCE OF A
BLOOD STAIN. AND WE CAN ALSO HAVE THEN THE EXPERTS TELL US HOW RARE IT
IS THAT YOU HAVE A BLOOD STAIN MATCHED TO THE TYPE OF A PARTICULAR
PERSON. I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE DETAILS OF ALL THAT TESTING, I'M
GOING TO LET THE EXPERTS TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT WHEN THEY COME IN AND
TESTIFY, BUT THEY WILL. THEY WILL COME IN AND TELL YOU ABOUT ALL OF THE
PROCESSES AND THEY WILL EXPLAIN HOW RARE IT IS TO FIND A MATCH BETWEEN A
BLOOD SPOT IN A PLACE AND A PARTICULAR PERSON. NOW, THE DEFENSE IS GOING
TO SPEAK TO YOU AT LENGTH ABOUT CONTAMINATION AND ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT
COULD ENSUE IN THE TESTING, BUT I WILL SIMPLY SAY THIS AT THIS POINT:
THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS BUILT INTO THE DNA TESTS THAT YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT
AND THESE SAFEGUARDS WILL SHOW WHEN PROBLEMS OCCUR. THIS IS ONE OF THE
REASONS WHY DNA TESTING IS SO RELIABLE. AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IN THIS
CASE WE HAVE MANY BLOOD STAINS, AS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN, NOT JUST ONE.
YOU MIGHT QUESTION IT IF ONLY ONE OF MANY BLOOD STAINS CAME BACK TO A
SUSPECT, BUT WHEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER MATCHES
THE SAME PERSON, THEN YOU REALIZE THAT THE TESTING IS ACCURATE, THAT IT
WORKS, AND THAT IF THERE WAS CONTAMINATION IT WOULDN'T KEEP COMING BACK
TO ONE PERSON; IT JUST WOULDN'T COME BACK AT ALL. AND ALTHOUGH WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE, AND SOMETIMES JUST SAYING THAT WORD CAN MAKE US
UNCOMFORTABLE, ALL YOU ARE GOING TO NEED IS COMMON SENSE AND LOGIC TO
FOLLOW THIS EVIDENCE. THAT IS ALL YOU WILL NEED. NOW, DNA TESTING IS NOT
ONLY USED TO SOLVE CRIMES, IT HAS MANY OTHER PURPOSES AS WELL. SOME OF
YOU TALKED ABOUT JURASSIC PARK AND THEY USED DNA TO MAKE DINOSAURS, BUT
THERE ARE OTHER MORE COMMON USES FOR IT AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS USED
IN AMNIOCENTESIS. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE AND WE
TALKED TO YOU DURING YOUR VOIR DIRE PROCESS, IF YOU RECALL. THAT IS THE
PROCESS WHERE YOU DETERMINE WHETHER A FETUS MAY HAVE A GENETIC DEFECT.
MOST OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT EITHER BY FIRST OR SECONDHAND
EXPERIENCE. AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT PROCESS IS THAT FLUID IS EXTRACTED
FROM THE MOTHER'S STOMACH, FROM THE SAC, AND THAT IS AMNIOTIC FLUID,
THAT IS THE FLUID THAT THE BABY FLOATS IN TO PROTECT IT, THEY ANALYZE
THAT FLUID TO SEE IF THE BABY HAS A GENETIC DEFECT. NOW, THAT PROCEDURE
HAS MANY OF THE SAME PROBLEMS --

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY WE APPROACH JUST A MINUTE?

*THE COURT:* YES. WITH THE REPORTER, PLEASE.

*MR. HODGMAN:* YOUR HONOR, WHILE COUNSEL IS APPROACHING SIDE BAR, IF WE
COULD MAKE TAKE A LITTLE STRETCH BREAK AND JUST STAND UP.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD AT THE BENCH:)

*THE COURT:* WE ARE AT THE SIDE BAR.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE KIND OF HAVE LIKE A LITTLE AGREEMENT SO I DIDN'T WANT
TO OBJECT, BUT WHEN SHE GOES INTO THINGS ABOUT AMNIOCENTESIS, SHE IS
TESTIFYING.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT IS WHAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW.

*THE COURT:* WELL, YOU ARE SPEAKING OF IT IN TERMS OF YOU ARE TELLING
THEM THIS.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOU TOLD THEM THAT.

*MS. CLARK:* YOU NEED TO SAY WITNESSES WILL TELL YOU, THE EVIDENCE WILL
SHOW THAT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES.

*MS. CLARK:* OKAY.

*THE COURT:* BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

*MS. CLARK:* I FORGOT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOU PROBABLY FORGOT.

*MS. CLARK:* I DID.

*MR. COCHRAN:* JUST REMEMBER THAT.

*MS. CLARK:* I'M SURE YOU ARE GOING TO DO FAR MORE OBJECTIONABLE THINGS
IN YOUR OPENING ARGUMENT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THAT IS NOT WHY WE ARE UP HERE.

*MR. DARDEN:* I DIDN'T AGREE TO ANYTHING.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I AM UP HERE TO BE A GENTLEMAN AND BRING IT TO YOUR
ATTENTION AND SHE TURNS IT AROUND AND SAYS I'M GOING TO DO FAR MORE
OBJECTIONABLE --

*THE COURT:* I MEAN IT ABSOLUTELY HONESTLY AND SINCERELY THAT I EXPECT
THIS TO BE A VERY PROFESSIONAL --

*MR. COCHRAN:* IT WILL BE.

*THE COURT:* -- ENTERPRISE HERE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE WILL.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU.

*MR. DARDEN:* WAS THAT OBJECTION SUSTAINED?

*THE COURT:* NO, IT IS A CAUTION. BE CAREFUL.

*MS. CLARK:* YES.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*THE COURT:* THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG TRIAL, AS YOU CAN TELL. IN THE
EVENT THAT YOU SHOULD NEED TO TAKE AND UNSCHEDULED COMFORT BREAK, AND WE
WILL TAKE REGULAR BREAKS, BUT IF SOMETHING COMES UP, FEEL FREE TO RAISE
YOUR HAND, BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME DURING THIS TRIAL, AND
I'M SURE IT WILL HAPPEN TO ONE OR TWO OF YOU DURING THE TRIAL, SO IF WE
HAVE TO TAKE AN UNSCHEDULED BREAK, THAT IS LIFE IN THE CITY, FEEL FREE
TO LET US KNOW. OUR REGULAR BREAKS YOU SHOULD EXPECT ABOUT EVERY HOUR
AND A HALF OR SO, AN HOUR AND 45 MINUTES. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR FIRST
BREAK THIS AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK. YOU NOTICE I'M VERY TIME
CONSCIOUS. I HAVE CLOCKS ALL OVER MY COURTROOM. ALL RIGHT. MISS CLARK,
WOULD YOU RESUME YOUR COMMENTS, PLEASE.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU.

*MS. CLARK:* NOW, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE AMNIOCENTESIS
PROCEDURE HAS MANY OF THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT CRIME SCENE ANALYSIS DOES
AND THOSE PROBLEMS ARE THAT YOU HAVE LIMITATIONS IN QUANTITY. THERE IS
ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN GET, RIGHT? IF YOU GO TO A CRIME SCENE, YOU COLLECT
THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU FIND AND YOU ARE LIMITED BY THAT. THE SAME THING
IS TRUE OF THE AMNIOCENTESIS. FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T WITHDRAW TOO MUCH
FLUID OR IT WILL ENDANGER THE BABY, NOT TO MENTION IT IS VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE MOTHER. YOU ARE LIMITED IN QUANTITY THEN IN BOTH
SITUATIONS. YOU ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A MIXTURE. BY THAT I MEAN AT A
CRIME SCENE YOU OFTEN HAVE A MIXTURE OF THE VICTIM'S BLOOD, EITHER WITH
EACH OTHER OR WITH THE DEFENDANT, AND THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO KNOW
HOW TO SEPARATE THEM OUT, WHO COULD BE THE SOURCE OF THIS AND WHAT
POSSIBLE MIXTURE YOU HAVE. THAT IS A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM TO THE
AMNIOCENTESIS WHERE YOU MIGHT PICK UP CELLS FROM THE MOTHER AND THEN YOU
ARE ANALYZING FOR THE GENETIC MAKE-UP OF THE MOTHER INSTEAD OF THE BABY,
SO THEY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO SEPARATE THAT OUT IN CASE IT HAPPENS, SO YOU
HAVE VERY SIMILAR SITUATIONS. ANOTHER SITUATION THAT IS SIMILAR TO CRIME
SCENE ANALYSIS IS IDENTIFICATION OF THE WAR DEAD. ONE OF THE TRAGIC
ASPECTS OF DYING IN A WAR IS THAT SOMETIMES WE ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING BUT
BODY PARTS AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHOSE THEY ARE. IN ORDER
TO ESTABLISH THE IDENTITY THEY WILL TAKE THAT BODY PART, EXTRACT THE DNA
AND DETERMINE IF IT MATCHES TO -- THAT GOES INTO A PARENTAL THING. YOU
HAVE TO TAKE THE PARENTS AND THEN YOU CAN TELL BASED UPON WHAT THE
PERSON'S MAKE-UP IS WHETHER THIS WAS THEIR CHILD. THAT IS ONE WAY OF
DOING IT. IT IS CALLED PATERNITY MATCH. DNA TESTING CAN DO THAT. NOW,
OBVIOUSLY THE BODY PARTS, TISSUES OR ORGANS THAT ARE FOUND IN WAR DEAD
ARE FOUND OUT IN JUNGLES, IN DESERTS, THEY ARE FOUND IN TERRIBLE PLACES
WHERE THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF DETERIORATION AND IT IS DIFFICULT,
THE SAME WAY AS IN A CRIME SCENE, BECAUSE IN A CRIME SCENE IT IS MESSY
AND DIRTY, THERE IS GOING TO BE A STREET, A SIDEWALK, A HOUSE, A CAR.
THAT IS NOT A LABORATORY SITUATION. WELL, IT IS THE SAME THING WITH THE
WAR DEAD. YOU HAVE KIND OF UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS THAT ARE GOING TO
DETERIORATE A SAMPLE VERY RAPIDLY, AND SO YOU HAVE A SIMILAR PROBLEM
WITH NON-CRIMINAL CRIME SCENE USES AS DO YOU WITH CRIME SCENE USES AND
YET DNA HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING THE WAR DEAD. ANOTHER
WAY THAT DNA HAS BEEN USED THAT IS NOT IN CRIME SCENE ANALYSIS IS IN
IDENTIFYING OLD REMAINS. BY THAT I MEAN SKELETONS. THEY EXTRACT THE DNA
FROM SKELETONS TO DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT ONCE THOSE
SKELETONS WERE, AND THEY DID THAT RECENTLY TO IDENTIFY THE RUSSIAN ROYAL
FAMILY THAT LIVED BACK IN 1917. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DNA TESTING
PROCEDURES IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL THAT IS USEFUL IN MANY, MANY WAYS,
NOT JUST IN CRIME SCENE ANALYSIS, BUT IN MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND IN
IDENTIFICATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN OTHER AREAS. NOW, THERE ARE A
COUPLE OF APPROACHES TO DNA TESTING THAT CAN BE TAKEN. THE FIRST ONE --
YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR THESE TERMS A LOT SO I'M GOING TO START YOU TODAY
-- IS RFLP. THAT STANDS FOR RESTRICTION FRAGMENT LENGTH POLYMORPHISM AND
ALL YOU HAVE TO KNOW IS RFLP FOR NOW. THE EXPERTS WILL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING TO YOU AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THAT IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
USED TO PINPOINT THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHO LEFT BLOOD OR HAIR OR
FIBER -- EXCUSE ME -- BLOOD OR HAIR OR BODILY FLUID IN AN AREA, VERY
POWERFUL TOOL. ANOTHER DNA TEST, NOT QUITE AS POWERFUL BUT STILL MORE
POWERFUL THAN WE USED TO HAVE, IS CALLED PCR, POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION.
IN THAT FORM OF TESTING YOU CAN TAKE MUCH SMALLER BITS OF DNA AND
AMPLIFY THEM. ACTUALLY YOU JUST MULTIPLY THEM LIKE XEROXING AND YOU MAKE
IT LARGE ENOUGH SO THAT YOU CAN TEST IT AND THAT HAS BEEN A VERY, VERY
IMPORTANT FULL TOOL AS WELL IN ANALYZING AND DETERMINING THE SOURCE OF A
STAIN OR BODILY FLUID THAT YOU FIND AT A CRIME SCENE. REGARDLESS OF THE
METHOD USED, WHETHER IT IS RFLP OR PCR, THEY ARE BOTH DNA TESTING AND
THE TESTS ARE REALLY TESTS OF EXCLUSION. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS
THAT WHEN YOU CONDUCT THESE TESTS, THE EFFORT IS TO EXCLUDE. YOU ANALYZE
THE DNA AND YOU SAY CAN I EXCLUDE THE SUSPECT? CAN I RULE HIM OUT? IS
THERE ANYTHING HERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUSPECT OR THE VICTIMS,
DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT? AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WAS DONE
IN THIS CASE WITH EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE COLLECTED. THE EFFORT WAS TO
EXCLUDE THE DEFENDANT AND TO EXCLUDE THE VICTIMS. THAT WAS THE FOCUS AND
THAT IS THE AIM OF DNA TESTING. IN THIS CASE WE ASKED THIS QUESTION OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. CAN THE DEFENDANT BE EXCLUDED? NO MATTER HOW
HARD WE TRIED, OVER AND OVER THE SAMPLES WERE TESTED AND RETESTED AND
TESTED AGAIN. OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE ASKED OURSELVES CAN THE DEFENDANT
BE EXCLUDED? AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE ANSWER WAS NO, THE
DEFENDANT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE FOR
YOU ALL OF THE TEST RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE
JUST DESCRIBED AND I'M GOING TO START WITH THE HAIR AND FIBER. NOW, THE
HAIR AND FIBER IS MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS; IT IS NOT DNA. THIS IS THE
COMPARISON OF HAIRS AND FIBERS FOUND ON VARIOUS ITEMS OF EVIDENCE AND IN
LOCATIONS AT THE SCENE THAT WERE COMPARED TO THE DEFENDANT, THE VICTIMS
AND VARIOUS OTHER ITEMS OF EVIDENCE. IT IS EASIER TO EXPLAIN TO YOU IF I
ACTUALLY TELL YOU THE RESULTS.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-14.

*MS. CLARK:* SKI CAP THAT WAS FOUND AT THE FEET OF RON GOLDMAN WAS
EXAMINED FOR HAIR AND TRACE ANALYSIS AND IT WAS FOUND ON THAT HAT THAT
THERE WAS FIBER LIKE THOSE FROM THE CARPET OF THE DEFENDANT'S FORD
BRONCO. NOW, STOP AND THINK. WHY WOULD THERE BE CARPET FIBERS LIKE THOSE
FROM THE DEFENDANT'S FORD BRONCO --

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, THAT IS ARGUMENTATIVE. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
OBJECT.

*THE COURT:* THAT'S TRUE. JUST STATE WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS. THANK YOU.

*MS. CLARK:* OKAY. ALSO ON THAT KNIT HAT WE FIND HAIRS LIKE THOSE OF THE
DEFENDANT, WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO FIND ON A HAT WORN BY THE
DEFENDANT. YOUR HONOR, THE NEXT ONE -- THE --

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-11.

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR, BEFORE WE PULL THAT UP --

*THE COURT:* I HAVE CUT IT.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU. ON THE SHIRT OF RON GOLDMAN WE FIND A HEAD HAIR
LIKE THAT OF THE DEFENDANT.

ON THE GLOVE FOUND AT THE DEFENDANT'S HOME AT ROCKINGHAM WE FIND HAIR
LIKE THOSE OF NICOLE BROWN, HAIR LIKE THOSE OF RON GOLDMAN, FIBERS LIKE
THOSE FROM THE SHIRT OF RON GOLDMAN AND FIBER LIKE THOSE FOUND IN THE
CARPET OF THE DEFENDANT'S FORD BRONCO.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-48.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS SHOWS YOU THE DEFENDANT'S FORD BRONCO. YOU SEE THE
TAGS. THOSE ALL INDICATE BLOOD SPOTS THAT WERE RECOVERED ON JUNE THE
14TH. THE BLOOD STAIN ON THE PANEL, AND I'M GOING TO TRY AND INDICATE IT
WITH THE RED LIGHT BECAUSE IT IS AT THE EDGE OF THE PHOTOGRAPH WHERE
THAT TAG IS, (INDICATING), THAT BLOOD, AS WELL AS THE BLOOD ON THE --
THAT BLOOD ON THE PANEL MATCHES THE DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-49.

*MS. CLARK:* THE BLOOD INDICATED HERE WITH THE NO. 34 MATCHES THE
DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-50.

*MS. CLARK:* THE BLOOD ON THE PANEL HERE MATCHES THE DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-51.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS BLOOD ON THE CONSOLE MATCHES THE DEFENDANT. THE ITEM
NO. 31 ON THE CONSOLE CONSISTENT WITH A MIXTURE OF THE DEFENDANT AND RON
GOLDMAN.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-53.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS BLOOD STAIN WAS ON THE CONSOLE. THIS WAS RECOVERED
LATER IN TIME AFTER THE 14TH. THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH A MIXTURE OF THE
DEFENDANT, RON GOLDMAN AND NICOLE BROWN.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-54.

*MS. CLARK:* THE BLOOD STAIN FOUND IN THIS AREA MARKED WITH THE NO. 33,
(INDICATING), MATCHES NICOLE.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-40.

*MS. CLARK:* ON THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD TRAIL THE ITEM NO. 6 WHICH IS --
THEY DON'T HAVE A CLOSE-UP OF IT. IT IS ONE OF THESE THREE MARKERS. WE
WILL HAVE IT BETTER EXPLAINED TO YOU WITH A DIAGRAM DURING THE TRIAL.
THE BLOOD SPOT NO. 6 MATCH IS THE DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-41.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS THE BLOOD SPOT NO. 7 WE SHOWED YOU BEFORE,
CLOSE-UP, MATCHES THE DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-42. P-43.

*MS. CLARK:* AGAIN THE BLOOD DROPS THAT WERE FOUND JUST INSIDE THE FRONT
ENTRY OF THE DEFENDANT'S HOME. THIS IS BLOOD DROPS NO. 12.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-44.

*MS. CLARK:* MATCHES THE DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-45.

*MS. CLARK:* THE SOCKS THAT WE INDICATED EARLIER TO YOU WERE FOUND IN
THIS CONDITION THROWN HASTILY AT THE FOOT OF THE DEFENDANT'S BED IN HIS
BEDROOM, THE BLOOD ON THOSE SOCKS WAS ANALYZED.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-46.

*MS. CLARK:* IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BLOOD ON ONE SPOT MATCHED THE
DEFENDANT; THE BLOOD ON ANOTHER SPOT MATCHED NICOLE.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-19 -- PARDON ME -- P-39.

*MS. CLARK:* THE GLOVE THAT WAS FOUND AT THE SOUTH WALKWAY OF THE
DEFENDANT'S PROPERTY AT ROCKINGHAM REVEALED BLOOD THAT WAS CONSISTENT
WITH A MIXTURE OF RON GOLDMAN, NICOLE BROWN AND THE DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-19.

*MS. CLARK:* THESE ARE BLOOD DROPS AT THE BUNDY LOCATION AT 875 SOUTH
BUNDY. THIS BLOOD DROP THAT YOU SEE HERE MARKED WITH THE ITEM NO. 112
MATCHES THE DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-21.

*MS. CLARK:* MATCHES THE DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-23.

*MS. CLARK:* MATCHES THE DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-25.

*MS. CLARK:* MATCHES THE DEFENDANT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* P-27.

*MS. CLARK:* MATCHES THE DEFENDANT. APART FROM THE TEST RESULTS, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, THE MERE FACT THAT WE FIND BLOOD WHERE THERE SHOULD BE NO
BLOOD IN THE DEFENDANT'S CAR, IN HIS HOUSE, IN THE DRIVEWAY AND EVEN ON
THE SOCKS IN HIS VERY BEDROOM AT THE FOOT OF HIS BED, THAT TRAIL OF
BLOOD FROM BUNDY THROUGH HIS OWN FORD BRONCO AND INTO HIS HOUSE IN
ROCKINGHAM IS DEVASTATING PROOF OF HIS GUILT. AND THE RESULTS OF THE
ANALYSIS OF THAT BLOOD CONFIRMS WHAT THE REST OF THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW
THAT ON JUNE THE 12TH, 1994, AFTER A VIOLENT RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH THE
DEFENDANT BEAT HER, HUMILIATED HER AND CONTROLLED HER, AFTER HE TOOK HER
YOUTH, HER FREEDOM AND HERSELF RESPECT, JUST AS SHE TRIED TO BREAK FREE
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, TOOK HER VERY LIFE IN WHAT AMOUNTED TO HIS FINAL
AND HIS ULTIMATE ACT OF CONTROL. AND IN THAT FINAL AND TERRIBLE ACT
RONALD GOLDMAN, AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER, WAS VICIOUSLY AND SENSELESSLY
MURDERED. REMEMBER THAT IN VOIR DIRE WE ASKED YOU IF YOU COULD USE YOUR
COMMON SENSE AND REASON TO FAIRLY AND TO OBJECTIVELY EVALUATE THIS
EVIDENCE AS NEUTRAL IMPARTIAL JUDGES OF THE FACTS. YOU ALL PROMISED THAT
YOU COULD AND YOU WOULD AND WE BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL.

WE HAVE EVERY FAITH AND BELIEF IN THE FACT THAT YOU WILL ALL KEEP THAT
PROMISE, BUT IT WILL NOT BE EASY. YOU WILL BE TESTED AND TEMPTED
THROUGHOUT THIS CASE TO ACCEPT THE UNREASONABLE AND BE DISTRACTED BY THE
IRRELEVANT. THE DEFENSE WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT POSSIBILITIES AND THEY
WILL INSINUATE MANY SINISTER THINGS BASED ON THOSE POSSIBILITIES,
POSSIBILITIES OF CONTAMINATION, POSSIBILITIES OF SET-UP, ALL IN AN
EFFORT TO EXPLAIN AWAY ALL OF THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, BUT POSSIBILITIES
ALONE DO NOT EQUAL PROOF. YOU'VE HEARD THE INSTRUCTION THAT SAYS THAT
ALL MATTERS SUBJECT TO HUMAN AFFAIRS ARE CAPABLE OF SOME POSSIBLE DOUBT.
THAT IS WHY THE STANDARD IS REASONABLE DOUBT. AND YOU WILL HEAR THE WORD
"REASONABLE" MORE THAN ONCE IN THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS AND YOU ALREADY
HAVE, BECAUSE IF THE PROOF STANDARD WAS BEYOND ALL POSSIBLE DOUBT, THERE
COULD NEVER BE A CONVICTION, THERE CAN ALWAYS BE A POSSIBLE DOUBT ABOUT
SOMETHING. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU HAVE A DOUBT THAT IS FOUNDED IN
REASON, SO BEWARE OF THE EFFORTS TO GET YOU TO ACCEPT THE UNREASONABLE,
BE DISTRACTED BY THE IRRELEVANT AND TO BASE YOUR DECISION ON
SPECULATION, ON MERE POSSIBILITIES WITH NO HARD EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT
ANY OF THEM REALLY OCCURRED. LISTEN CAREFULLY TO ALL THE POSSIBILITIES
AND THE HINTS RAISED BY THE DEFENDANTS AND ASK YOURSELVES IS THERE ANY
PROOF THAT ANY OF THESE POSSIBILITIES ACTUALLY OCCURRED? LISTEN
CAREFULLY FOR THE DEFENSE TO EXPLAIN HOW THE DEFENDANT'S BLOOD GOT ON
875 SOUTH BUNDY WALKWAY. IT IS GOING TO BE UP TO YOU, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE EVER VIGILANT IN ACTING AS THE
JUDGES IN THIS CASE. EACH ONE OF YOU IS A JUDGE. EACH ONE OF YOU IS A
TRIER OF FACT. YOU HAVE TO EXAMINE ALL THE EVIDENCE VERY CAREFULLY AND
ASK YOU DO ASK YOURSELVES IS THIS REASONABLE? IS THIS LOGICAL? DOES THIS
MAKE SENSE? WOULD I LOOK AT THIS EVIDENCE THE SAME WAY --

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, SHE IS STARTING TO ARGUE NOW.

*THE COURT:* SOUNDS LIKE ARGUMENT TO ME.

*MS. CLARK:* LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD FOR ANY OTHER
CASE. NOW, WINNING IS NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. THIS IS NOT A GAME. THIS
IS ABOUT JUSTICE AND SEEING THAT JUSTICE IS DONE. TWO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
BRUTALLY MURDERED AND THE EVIDENCE CONSISTENTLY WILL POINT TO THE GUILT
OF ONLY ONE PERSON AS THE MURDERER.

*MR. COCHRAN:* OBJECTION AS ARGUMENT.

*MS. CLARK:* TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW.

*THE COURT:* ARE YOU ABOUT TO CONCLUDE?

*MS. CLARK:* UH-HUH. THANK YOU. THERE WAS NO RUSH TO JUDGMENT IN THIS
CASE. IT WAS VERY CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BEFORE IT WAS FILED. THE EVIDENCE
WILL SHOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT AS OF JUNE THE 15TH MANY DNA
RESULTS HAD ALREADY BEEN RETURNED. AS OF JUNE THE 15TH THERE HAD ALREADY
BEEN A MATCH BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE BLOOD FOUND AT BUNDY DRIVE.
THERE HAD ALREADY BEEN A MATCH BETWEEN THE VICTIMS AND THE BLOOD FOUND
ON THE GLOVE AT HIS HOUSE. MANY THINGS WERE KNOWN AND YET IT WAS
EXAMINED CAREFULLY, THE ENTIRE CASE EXAMINED VERY CAREFULLY, AND WAS NOT
FILED UNTIL TWO DAYS AFTER THOSE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED. MY JOB IS TO
SEEK JUSTICE. I'VE HAD CASES BEFORE THIS ONE, THERE WILL BE CASES AFTER
IT. THIS THIS CASE NOT ABOUT THE LAWYERS, MYSELF, MR. HODGMAN, MR.
DARDEN OR MR. COCHRAN. YOU WILL HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT THIS CASE IS
ABOUT; JUSTICE FOR ALL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF THOSE WORDS ARE TO MEAN
ANYTHING, WE MUST ALL BE EQUAL IN THE EYES OF THE LAW AND WE CANNOT USE
A SLIDING SCALE TO JUDGE GUILT OR INNOCENCE BASED ON A DEFENDANT OR A
VICTIM'S POPULARITY. WE LIVE IN VERY, VERY STRANGE TIMES.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, SHE IS ARGUING.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, THIS HAS ALL BEEN ARGUMENT FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES.

*MS. CLARK:* I WILL WRAP UP, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* PLEASE.

*MS. CLARK:* WE CANNOT SUCCUMB TO THE TEMPTATION TO THWART JUSTICE AND
THROW TRUTH OUT THE WINDOW.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO STOP YOU RIGHT HERE. I HAVE
WARNED YOU THREE TIMES NOW.

*MS. CLARK:* ALL WE ARE ASKING IS THAT --

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, I'M WARNING YOU. I HAVE WARNED YOU THREE TIMES NOW.

*MS. CLARK:* I AM CONCLUDING RIGHT NOW, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* PLEASE.

*MS. CLARK:* MAY I?

*THE COURT:* PLEASE.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU. ALL WE ASK IS THAT YOU STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT THE
CASE IS ABOUT, ABOUT THE MURDER OF RON GOLDMAN.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, WILL YOU APPROACH, PLEASE.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

*MS. CLARK:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION IN THIS MATTER AND TO THANK
YOU ALSO ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US FOR PUTTING UP WITH THE RIGORS OF
SEQUESTRATION. WE ALL KNOW IT IS DIFFICULT, AND WE APPRECIATE ALL OF
YOUR DEDICATION TO DUTY AND SERVICE IN THIS CASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MISS CLARK. ALL RIGHT. LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, I THINK WE WILL TAKE OUR RECESS JUST A LITTLE BIT EARLY. LET
ME ASK DEPUTY MAGNERA, HOW MUCH TIME DO WE NEED? AT LEAST 25 MINUTES?

*DEPUTY MAGNERA:* TWENTY MINUTES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WE WILL RECONVENE AT 25 MINUTES AFTER 3:00. ALL
RIGHT. THANK YOU.

(RECESS.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, BACK ON THE RECORD, PLEASE. LET'S HAVE IT QUIET IN
THE COURTROOM, PLEASE. BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. ALL
PARTIES ARE AGAIN PRESENT. THE JURY IS NOT PRESENT. COUNSEL, I WANT TO
BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION TWO MATTERS. FIRST OF ALL, NOW THAT WE ACTUALLY
HAVE A JURY IMPANELED AND HEARING THE CASE, I URGE COUNSEL NOT TO USE
THE REST ROOM FACILITIES IN THE JURY ROOM BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
BEING IN THERE AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH IS NOT APPROPRIATE. THE SECOND
MATTER IS MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT. IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION OVER THE
RECESS THAT A TELEVISION FEED WAS SENT OUT OF THIS COURTROOM WHICH
INCLUDED A VIEW OF OUR ALTERNATE JURORS, WHICH IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF
RULE 980. AND I HAVE NOW CUT THE VIDEO FEED GOING OUT OF THE COURTROOM.
THAT IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF 980 AND I'M GOING TO TERMINATE THE
TELEVISION COVERAGE AS A RESULT OF THAT.

*MR. SHAPIRO:* YOUR HONOR, MAY I BE HEARD?

*THE COURT:* YES. MR. SHAPIRO.

*MR. SHAPIRO:* YOUR HONOR, WE --

*THE COURT:* I MIGHT ADD, THE VIDEO SIGNAL WENT OUT, THE PERSON
OPERATING THE DELAY DEVICE DID NOT CUT THE VIDEO FEED AFTER THAT WENT
OUT AND IT WAS BROADCAST TO THE PUBLIC. SO BOTH THE CAMERA OPERATOR MADE
AN ERROR AND THE PERSON ON THE DELAY BOX MADE AN ERROR, AND I INDICATED
TO ALL PARTIES THAT IF THIS WOULD OCCUR, THEN I WOULD TERMINATE THE
TELEVISION COVERAGE.

*MR. SHAPIRO:* YOUR HONOR, WE SHARE THE COURT'S CONCERN AND ESPECIALLY
VIOLATING SOMETHING AS BASIC AS SHOWING THE JURORS, WHICH THE COURT HAS
OVEREMPHASIZED TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

*THE COURT:* I MIGHT ADD THAT I VIEWED THE VIDEOTAPE OF IT. SO --

*MR. SHAPIRO:* AND WE ARE EQUALLY CONCERNED AND DO NOT WISH TO ADDRESS
THAT ISSUE ANY FURTHER. HOWEVER, WE ARE REPRESENTING A MAN WHOSE LIFE IS
AT STAKE IN THIS TRIAL AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT
HE IS WRONGLY CHARGED. AND, THEREFORE, HIS LIFE AFTER THIS TRIAL IN THE
WORLD OF PUBLIC OPINION IS ALSO AT STAKE. AND IN FAIRNESS TO MR.
SIMPSON, TO HIS MOTHER, HIS SISTERS, HIS CHILDREN, WHO ARE HERE, HIS
FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS WORLDWIDE, I THINK IT WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY
UNFAIR TO HAVE THE WORLD SEE THE OPENING STATEMENTS OF THE PROSECUTION
AND NOT SEE THE OPENING STATEMENTS ON BEHALF OF MR. SIMPSON. SO WE WILL
NOT OBJECT TO THE COURT TERMINATING THE TELEVISION COVERAGE AS THE COURT
HAS INDICATED, BUT WE WOULD SINCERELY ASK YOUR HONOR TO RECONSIDER
BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT THIS WILL HAVE ON MR. SIMPSON, ON THE PRESUMPTION
OF INNOCENCE AND ON HIS LIFE AFTER THIS CASE AND IF IN FACT HE IS
RENDERED INNOCENT OF THESE CHARGES. AND ON BEHALF OF MR. SIMPSON AND HIS
FAMILY, WE ASK YOUR HONOR, PLEASE, TO AIR OUR OPENING STATEMENT ALSO.
AFTER THAT, WE WILL SHARE THE COURT'S VIEW OF THE ISSUE.

*THE COURT:* PEOPLE, ANY COMMENT?

*MS. CLARK:* WELL, YOUR HONOR, THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE TO HEAR FROM BOTH
SIDES IS THE JURY. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT MATTER HERE. THE DEFENDANT WILL
HAVE HIS OPENING STATEMENT HEARD BY THE PEOPLE WHO WILL VOTE ON THE
ISSUE OF GUILT OR INNOCENCE, AND THAT IS WHAT COUNTS. THE RADIO IS
ALLOWED TO I UNDERSTAND BROADCAST IT; IS THAT CORRECT? THE AUDIO FEED IS
NOT TURNED ON; IS THAT -- THAT'S A QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO
-- I'M ASKING. WE HAVE PRINT MEDIA HERE. WE HAVE REPORTERS HERE, ALL OF
WHOM WILL BE ABLE TO PRINT IN A WORD-BY-WORD BASIS EVERYTHING THAT IS
SAID BY COUNSEL. BUT WE ARE NOT PLAYING TO THE WORLD HERE, YOUR HONOR.
WE'RE PLAYING TO THE JURY. THE JURY IS THE ONE THAT HAS TO HEAR
EVERYTHING, AND THEY WILL WHETHER THE COURT CUTS THE FEED OR NOT. BUT WE
DO -- THE PRESS IS PRESENT IN FULL FORCE AND THEY WILL BE HERE TO REPORT
EVERYTHING THAT'S SAID.

*THE COURT:* WELL, OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION. I'M NOT AWARE
OF ANY OTHER COURT THAT'S BEEN PLACED IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THIS
PARTICULAR TYPE OF DILEMMA. I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU MY CONCERN AND MY
DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE ELECTRONIC NEWS MEDIA FOR THEIR INABILITY TO
FOLLOW A VERY FUNDAMENTAL AND BASIC RULE. AND BEFORE MR. SHAPIRO RAISED
THE CONCERN THAT MR. SIMPSON HAS, THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF
FAIRNESS TOO AS FAR AS HIS REPUTATION IS CONCERNED. I'M VERY COGNIZANT
OF HIS INTEREST IN PRESERVING AS MUCH AS HE CAN OF HIS REPUTATION UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A VERY UNUSUAL SITUATION I FIND MYSELF IN. ON
THE ONE HAND, I'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE NEWS MEDIA THAT IF THERE'S
A VIOLATION OF RULE 980, THAT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR PRIVILEGE IN THIS
COURTROOM. THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED AN INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE
COURT'S ORDER. SO MY INCLINATION IS TO TERMINATE ALL TELEVISION COVERAGE
AT THIS POINT.

*MR. SHAPIRO:* YOUR HONOR, MAY I BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN?

*THE COURT:* NO. I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. I DON'T THINK
EMBELLISHING ON ANY OF THIS IS GOING TO HELP ME ON THIS DECISION. ON THE
ONE HAND, I HAVE MY CREDIBILITY AS A JUDGE AT STAKE. BUT I TOLD THEM
THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IF THEY VIOLATED MY ORDER. I ALSO HAVE TO
BALANCE FAIRNESS TO YOUR CLIENT CERTAINLY IN MAKING A DECISION. OUR
FRIENDS IN THE NEWS MEDIA, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. LET'S TAKE A RECESS. IN
FACT, I'M GOING TO TAKE A RECESS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. THIS IS
UNBELIEVABLE. WE'LL STAND IN RECESS. I WANT KELLI SAGER HERE AT 8:30.

*MR. DARDEN:* WHAT ABOUT THE JURY?

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* I NEED TO ADMONISH THE JURY BEFORE I LET THEM LOOSE.

*THE BAILIFF:* DO YOU WANT THE JURY OUT NOW?

*THE COURT:* YES, PLEASE.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, IN THE PRESENCE OF
THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BE SEATED, PLEASE. THANK
YOU. ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THERE'S A
RULE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR CALLED MURPHY'S LAW THAT BASICALLY SAYS IF
SOMETHING CAN GO WRONG, IT WILL GO WRONG, AND THE COROLLARY TO THAT RULE
IS THAT IF IT'S GOING TO GO WRONG, IT WILL GO WRONG AT THE MOST
OPPORTUNE MOMENT. SOMETHING HAS COME UP THAT INVOLVES DIRECTLY YOUR
WELFARE, A PROBLEM THAT I'M GOING TO NEED TO DEAL WITH. AND I NEED SOME
TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT, DECIDE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. AND IT'S A RATHER
UNUSUAL PROBLEM AND IT HAS -- I WANT YOU TO KNOW IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANYTHING THAT THE PARTIES DID. IT'S SOMETHING EXTRANEOUS, SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM THAT I NEED TO DEAL WITH. YOU ARE
NOT TO SPECULATE AS TO WHAT THAT MIGHT BE. AND LET ME BE FRANK WITH YOU.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU DIRECTLY. BUT IT HAS CAUSED ME GREAT
CONCERN, AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE REST OF THE COURT DAY TO DEAL
WITH THIS SITUATION. SO WE'RE GOING TO STAND IN RECESS AT THIS POINT AS
FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED. WE WILL RESUME WITH YOU, THE JURY, WITH THE
DEFENDANT'S OPENING STATEMENTS TOMORROW MORNING AT 10:00 O'CLOCK.

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY WE APPROACH JUST ONE SECOND?

*THE COURT:* SURE.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND,
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL WELFARE OR SAFETY. IT'S AN
ISSUE THAT IS A JURY ISSUE, BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR WELFARE
OR SAFETY. ALSO, THIS IS A VERY UNUSUAL POINT IN THE PROCEEDINGS, TO
HAVE TO TAKE AN EXTENDED RECESS, BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE HEARD THE OPENING
STATEMENT MADE BY THE PROSECUTION. I WANT YOU TO BE VERY CAREFUL, VERY
DILIGENT, THAT YOU KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN THIS CASE BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE
TO HEAR THE OPENING STATEMENT TO BE MADE ON BEHALF OF MR. SIMPSON AS
WELL. SO LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY. YOU ARE NOT TO FORM ANY OPINIONS ABOUT
THIS CASE. YOU ARE NOT TO FORM ANY JUDGMENTS. YOU ARE NOT TO EXPRESS ANY
OPINIONS. YOU ARE NOT TO TALK TO ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT THIS CASE NOR ALLOW
YOURSELF TO BE ADDRESSED ABOUT THIS CASE. ALL RIGHT. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT VERY CAREFULLY TODAY BECAUSE IN FAIRNESS, BOTH
SIDES OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO YOU TO MAKE THEIR STATEMENTS TO
YOU AT THE SAME TIME. SO KEEP AN OPEN MIND. THEN WE'LL HEAR THE OPENING
STATEMENT BY MR. SIMPSON'S COUNSEL TOMORROW MORNING. I APOLOGIZE TO YOU
SINCERELY FOR THIS DELAY. BELIEVE ME, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
PARTIES HERE. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAME UP THAT'S
HIGHLY UNUSUAL THAT I NEED TO DEAL WITH. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL STAND IN
RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING AS FAR AS THE JURY IS CONCERNED 10:00
O'CLOCK. I WANT COUNSEL HERE AT 9:00 O'CLOCK. THAT'S THE ORDER.

*MR. DARDEN:* CAN WE APPROACH AT SIDEBAR WITHOUT THE REPORTER?
