DEPARTMENT NO. 103 HON. LANCE A. ITO, JUDGE

APPEARANCES: (APPEARANCES AS HERETOFORE NOTED.)

(JANET M. MOXHAM, CSR NO. 4855, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(CHRISTINE M. OLSON, CSR NO. 2378, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. GOOD MORNING, COUNSEL.

*MR. HODGMAN:* GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR. YOUR HONOR --

*THE COURT:* HOLD ON.

*MR. HODGMAN:* EXCUSE ME.

*THE COURT:* BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER, MR. SIMPSON IS
AGAIN PRESENT BEFORE THE COURT WITH HIS COUNSEL, MR. SHAPIRO, MR.
COCHRAN, MR. BAILEY, MR. UELMEN. THE PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED BY MR.
HODGMAN, MR. GORDON, MISS BODIN AND MR. GOLDBERG. MR. HODGMAN.

*MR. HODGMAN:* YES. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. MAY COUNSEL AND I APPROACH
JUST FOR A MOMENT WITH REGARD -- IT IS NOT IN RELATION TO THIS MOTION.

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

*MR. HODGMAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS BODIN, DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE YOUR REMARKS?

*MS. BODIN:* YES, YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR. YOUR
HONOR, WE HAVE GIVEN THE COURT A CHART BECAUSE THE COURT HAD AT THE LAST
MOMENT IN COURT YESTERDAY ASKED US TO SPECIFICALLY TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC
ACTS, AND I HAVE AN EXTRA IF THE COURT NEEDS IT.

*THE COURT:* I THINK I LEFT IT ON --

*MS. BODIN:* YOUR HONOR, WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE. MR. GORDON WILL BRING IT
TO YOU.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. MISS BODIN.

*MS. BODIN:* WHAT THIS CHART DOES, AND THE DEFENSE IS ALSO IN POSSESSION
OF IT, IDENTIFIES TO THE COURT THOSE INCIDENTS WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE
PROVABLE THAT THE COURT SHOULD SPECIFICALLY RULE ON IN THIS HEARING.
HOWEVER, THERE ALREADY OTHER INCIDENTS THAT APPEAR ON THIS CHART AND YOU
WILL SEE THAT THEY ARE LINED OUT. WE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE THOSE, AND
I WILL SAY THIS AGAIN, WE ARE GOING TO INVESTIGATE THEM, WE ARE
INVESTIGATING THEM. IF WE GET INFORMATION ON THEM, WE WOULD SEEK AT A
LATER TIME TO PRESENT EVIDENCE ON THOSE INCIDENTS. FURTHERMORE, WE ARE
GIVING OUR EXPERT THOSE -- THOSE INCIDENTS TO LOOK IT IN TERMS OF
FORMING AN EXPERT OPINION. ADDITIONALLY, WE WOULD PROBABLY AND WE WILL,
WE WILL SEEK TO CROSS WITNESSES WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE WITH REGARD TO
THOSE INCIDENTS WITH THAT IN MIND. AND HAVING SAID THAT, WE HAVE LINED
OUT SOME OF THE -- THE INCIDENTS THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED YESTERDAY AND WE
USED THE COURT'S NUMBERING SCHEME FROM THE CHART THAT THE COURT HAD
GRACIOUSLY GIVEN US SEVERAL DAYS AGO. I DON'T KNOW IF THE COURT WISHES
ME TO ONCE AGAIN DISCREETLY AND QUICKLY DISCUSS EACH ONE OF THOSE
INCIDENTS. I CAN DO THAT OR I CAN CONTINUE WITH AN ARGUMENT. HOW WOULD
YOU LIKE ME TO PROCEED, YOUR HONOR?

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I MAKE A SUGGESTION, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY.

*MR. COCHRAN:* BECAUSE OF THE WIDE CIRCULATION OF WHAT THE PROSECUTION
DID YESTERDAY IN LAYING OUT ALL THIS LAUNDRY LIST OF ALLEGATIONS, I
THINK IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT THEY STATE FOR THE RECORD THE ONES THAT THEY
ARE NOT GOING TO PROCEED ON, AND I WOULD ASK THAT, SPECIFICALLY LIKE
REYNOZA.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. I'M JUST HAVING MY CLERK MAKE ME AN EXTRA COPY
SO I CAN WRITE ON ONE AND KEEP ONE FOR THE RECORD, BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY,
MISS BODIN, WHAT YOU ARE INDICATING TO THE COURT IS THAT THE ITEMS THAT
YOU HAVE LINED OUT ON YOUR CHART ARE THE ONES THAT YOU DO NOT AT THIS
TIME PROPOSE TO PRESENT, CORRECT?

*MS. BODIN:* THAT'S CORRECT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. SO FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE RECORD THEN, I'M
GOING TO INCLUDE A COPY OF YOUR CHART IN THE COURT'S RULING AS AN APPENDIX.

*MS. BODIN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*THE COURT:* IT WILL BE BECOME PART OF THE OFFICIAL COURT RECORD.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. BODIN:* FINALLY, YOUR HONOR, BEFORE I START GOING THROUGH THE
INCIDENTS, THE COURT SHOULD KNOW THAT BY CROSSING THESE OUT WE ARE NOT
COMMENTING ON THE TRUTH OF THESE WITNESSES OR THE UNTRUTH OF THEM OR THE
CREDIBILITY OF ANY OF THE WITNESSES. WE ARE JUST SIMPLY SAYING AT THIS
POINT THE COURT NEEDS TO MAKE A RULING AND THESE ARE THE RULINGS THAT WE
ARE REQUESTING ON SPECIFIC INCIDENTS, BUT WE ARE NOT LIMITING OURSELVES
WITH REGARD TO ANY FUTURE RULINGS THE COURT WOULD MAKE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. BODIN:* HAVING SAID THAT, USING THE CHART, GOING TO JUDGE'S
INCIDENT NO. 3, THAT WOULD BE THE INCIDENT WHEN MRS. SIMPSON WENT TO THE
HOME OF WAYNE HUGHES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND SHOWED HIM A RED
SPOT ON HER, AND WE -- EXCUSE ME. I'VE GOT A TERRIBLE COLD THE LAST
COUPLE DAYS. I APOLOGIZE.

WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO AN EXCITED UTTERANCE. THERE IS
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND THIS IS FROM AN EYEWITNESS WHO SAW HER WITH THIS
RED SPOT. SHE HAD ASKED HIM TO PLEASE TALK TO THE DEFENDANT IN THIS
CASE. IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE PER THE ZACK CASE. MOVING
DOWN NOW TO JUDGE'S INCIDENT NO. 7, THAT IS THE LA CANTINA INCIDENT,
THAT OCCURRED --

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, I'M NOT CLEAR. I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO
INDICATE THE ONES SHE WAS NOT GOING TO GO ON.

*MS. BODIN:* I'M SORRY.

*MR. COCHRAN:* SHE SKIPPED TO 3.

*THE COURT:* WHY DON'T WE TAKE IT FROM THE TOP.

*MS. BODIN:* INCIDENT NO. 1 WE ARE CROSSING OUT. THAT WOULD BE A JOURNAL
ENTRY WITH REGARD TO AN INCIDENT HAPPENING IN SAN FRANCISCO WHEREIN THE
DEFENDANT HIT THE VICTIM AND THREW HER CLOTHES DOWN ON THE FLOOR. NO. 2,
A NEW YORK INCIDENT WHERE THE DEFENDANT HIT THE VICTIM IN PUBLIC WHERE
SHE HAD TO ASK HELP FROM PASSERBYS -- PASSERBYS. NO. 3 I HAVE JUST
TALKED ABOUT, THAT WOULD BE THE WAYNE HUGHES RED SPOT INCIDENT. NO. 4
WOULD BE THE INCIDENT IN THE WINE CLOSET, WHERE SHE WAS LOCKED IN THE
WINE CLOSET AND WAS PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED BY THE DEFENDANT.

*THE COURT:* YOU ARE WITHDRAWING THAT?

*MS. BODIN:* WE ARE, YES. NO. 5 JOURNAL ENTRY WE ARE WITHDRAWING WITH
REGARD TO SAN JOSE TRACK INCIDENT AND THAT WAS WHERE SHE WAS HIT AND
LEFT ON THE ROADSIDE BY THE DEFENDANT. NO. 6 WE ARE WITHDRAWING. THAT IS
THE INCIDENT WHERE SHE WROTE A NOTE TO HERSELF AND THE DEFENDANT FOUND
THE NOTE AND THEN HIT HER. NO. 7 WE ARE KEEPING.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, I MUST OBJECT. COUNSEL -- WE ARE IN COURT TO
DETERMINE IT APPROPRIATE. IT SEEMS TO ME SHE OUGHT TO SAY "ALLEGED"
INCIDENT. SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER THAT HAPPENED OR NOT.

*MR. SHAPIRO:* THEY ARE WITHDRAWING IT AT THIS TIME, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* I JUST NEED TO NOW WHICH ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS YOU ARE
WITHDRAWING. IF YOU ARE TELLING ME YOU ARE WITHDRAWING THE SAN JOSE
TRACK INCIDENT, I KNOW WHICH ONE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

*MS. BODIN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* NO. 6 IS A JOURNAL ENTRY YOU ARE WITHDRAWING.

*MS. BODIN:* YES. NO. 7. THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE CAN PROVE THIS. IT IS
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS PHYSICALLY VIOLENT AND
IT IS EVIDENCE OF EMOTIONAL ABUSE, PHYSICAL ABUSE AND PROPERTY ABUSE.
NO. 8, SMASHING OF PICTURES AT ROCKINGHAM, SHOWS PROPERTY DESTRUCTION.
THERE ARE EYEWITNESSES TO THIS INCIDENT. NO. 9, THE INCIDENT WHERE THE
DEFENDANT TOOK A BASEBALL BAT TO A WHITE MERCEDES BELONGING TO THE
VICTIM, THERE ARE EYEWITNESSES, THERE ARE TWO OF THEM TO THIS. THE
DEFENDANT MADE ADMISSIONS AND THERE WERE EXCITED UTTERANCES GIVEN BY
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WITH REGARD TO THIS INCIDENT. THE BICYCLE INCIDENT
INVOLVING DR. ALPERT, THAT WILL BE NO. 10 NOW AT THIS POINT ON THE LIST,
WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS EVIDENCE OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE PER PEOPLE VERSUS
ZACK AND THERE ARE EYEWITNESSES TO THAT WITH REGARD TO THE INJURIES AND
ALSO THERE ARE MEDICAL RECORDS. NO. 11 IN THE COURT'S CHART, THIS WAS --
THIS WAS THE INCIDENT IN HAWAII WHERE THE DEFENDANT BECAME ENRAGED
BECAUSE A GAY MAN KISSED HIS CHILD. WE BELIEVE THAT PER ZACK AND DANIELS
IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF HUMILIATION AND THAT HE WAS ABUSIVE TO THE VICTIM
AND MISTREATED HIS FAMILY. THERE WAS ALSO AN EYEWITNESS. THERE IS THE
DISNEY ON ICE, NO. 12, WHEREIN THE DEFENDANT CALLED HER A FAT SLOB AND
DENIGRATED HER WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT. WE HAVE A WITNESS TO THAT, AL
COWLINGS, AND IT IS EVIDENCE OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE PER ZACK AND EMOTIONAL
ABUSE PER DE MOSS AND THERE ARE EYEWITNESSES TO THIS.

*THE COURT:* I THINK THE COURT REPORTER WANTS YOU TO SLOW DOWN.

*MS. BODIN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR, AND I WILL. JUDGE'S INCIDENT NO. 13,
1989, NEW YEAR'S DAY. THIS OF COURSE IS VERY WELL DOCUMENTED. THERE ARE
1240 STATEMENTS. THERE ARE EYEWITNESSES. THERE ARE LETTERS WHERE THE
DEFENDANT ADOPTS THE -- ADOPTS THE INCIDENT, NUMEROUS PIECES OF
EVIDENCE. THE PEOPLE WOULD BE CROSSING OUT ON JUDGE'S NO. 14 ALSO
RELATING TO THE 1989 NEW YEAR'S DAY INCIDENT. THE COURT HAD LISTED AS
SEPARATE AS TO INCIDENT NO. 15, THE PRENUPTIAL LETTER. THE PEOPLE WOULD
BE SEEKING TO ADMIT THAT AS A DOCUMENT THAT ADMITS THE INCIDENTS THAT
OCCURRED ON NEW YEAR'S DAY OF 1989. STATEMENT TO KRIS JENNER WE CONSIDER
A 1250 STATEMENT OF FEAR. IF THE COURT WOULDN'T MIND, THE COURT HAD
SPECIFICALLY ASKED ME AT THE END OF YESTERDAY TO ADDRESS THE 1250 ISSUE
AND AT THE END OF GOING THROUGH THIS CHART I'M GOING TO ARGUE THAT.
JUDGE'S INCIDENT NO. 17, THAT WAS THE INCIDENT INVOLVING ALFRED ACOSTA,
THE LIMOUSINE DRIVER. IT IS DEMONSTRATIVE OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AND THERE
IS AN EYEWITNESS TO IT. JUDGE'S INCIDENT NO. 18, THAT IS THE INCIDENT
THAT OCCURRED AT THE RED ONION, AND I MADE A MISTAKE YESTERDAY IN MY
RELATION OF THE FACTS AND I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT IT ON THE RECORD. I
STATED THAT IT WAS THE MALIBU RED ONION AND IN FACT IT WAS THE SANTA ANA
RED ONION. I WOULDN'T WANT THE WRONG RED ONION TO GET CREDIT FOR THIS SO
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE LOCATION IS CORRECT. NO. 19, STATEMENT BY D'ANNE
LE BON, WE ARE CROSSING THAT OUT. STATEMENT OF THE VICTIM, I'M SORRY, TO
D'ANNE LE BON, NO. 19, WE ARE CROSSING THAT OUT. NO. 20, THE INCIDENT
WHERE THE DEFENDANT STATED HE CUT SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF WITH REGARD TO
SOMEONE ELSE DRIVING HIS WIFE'S CAR --

*THE COURT:* WITH REGARDS TO THAT ONE INCIDENT, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT
TO MAKE CLEAR THAT YOU ARE WITHDRAWING THAT ONE PARTICULAR INCIDENT,
BECAUSE THE NEWS MEDIA WAS ABLAZE LAST NIGHT WITH THIS PARTICULAR
INCIDENT AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE CLEAR ON THE RECORD THAT THE
PROSECUTION WITHDRAWS THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT.

*MS. BODIN:* YES, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. SHAPIRO:* YOUR HONOR, WOULD IT BE PROPER FOR THE COURT TO ASK THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHY THEY ARE WITHDRAWING THIS AT THIS TIME?

*MR. COCHRAN:* FURTHER, COULD THE COURT ALSO MAKE SURE THEY MENTION THE
NAME OF THE ALLEGED WITNESS IN THIS INCIDENT ALSO.

*THE COURT:* I THINK SHE JUST DID.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I DIDN'T HEAR IT.

*THE COURT:* SHE SAID THE REYNOZA INCIDENT, AS I RECALL, BUT LET'S SEE
-- BUT IN ANY EVENT, THIS IS THE EDDIE REYNOZA INCIDENT, THE ALLEGED
STATEMENTS MADE.

*MS. BODIN:* WELL, YOUR HONOR -- I'M SORRY.

*THE COURT:* BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PROSECUTION INTENDS TO WITHDRAW
THIS INCIDENT, CORRECT?

*MS. BODIN:* THAT'S CORRECT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. BODIN:* DOES THE COURT WISH ME TO MAKE ANY OTHER STATEMENT OTHER
THAN WE ARE JUST WITHDRAWING IT AT THIS TIME? BUT IF WE HAVE OTHER
COMPETENT PROOF AT A LATER TIME --

*THE COURT:* I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT RIGHT NOW YOU'VE EVALUATED AND YOU
CHOOSE TO WITHDRAW IT?

*MS. BODIN:* CORRECT. INCIDENT NO. 21 WE ARE KEEPING. THAT IS JUST
SIMPLY THE FILING FOR A DIVORCE. THAT IS WELL-DOCUMENTED. JUDGE'S
INCIDENT NO. 22, THAT IS THE INCIDENT AT MEZZALUNA WHERE THE DEFENDANT
STARED AND MADE A COMMENT WITH REGARD TO NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON STILL
BEING HIS WIFE. YOUR HONOR, COULD THE COURT DIRECT THE DEFENDANT NOT TO
MAKE COMMENTS DURING MY ARGUMENT TO THE COURT?

*MR. COCHRAN:* HE WAS SPEAKING TO ME, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* MISS BODIN.

*MS. BODIN:* YES, THANK YOU. JUDGE'S INCIDENT NO. 23 WITH REGARD TO
AGAIN THE DEFENDANT SHOWING UP AT A RESTAURANT CALLED TRYST WHICH WE
BELIEVE IS EVIDENCE OF STALKING AND SHOWS JEALOUSLY, AS DOES THE
MEZZALUNA INCIDENT, WE WOULD INTEND TO KEEP THAT. JUDGE'S INCIDENT NO.
24, THIS IS THE INCIDENT INVOLVING THE DEFENDANT LOOKING THROUGH THE
WINDOW OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S HOME ON GRETNA GREEN WAY WHERE HE SAW
HER IN AN INTIMATE ACT.

*THE COURT:* MISS BODIN, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU AT THIS POINT, SINCE IT
APPEARS ON YOUR LIST, THE SECOND PAGE, WHETHER YOU INTEND TO CONTINUE TO
OFFER THOSE ITEMS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED AND FLIP OVER THEN -- AT
THIS POINT WE ARE TRYING TO SETTLE THE STATE OF THE RECORD AS TO WHAT IT
IS YOU INTEND -- WHAT IT IS YOU INTEND TO WITHDRAW AT THIS POINT, SO
LET'S JUMP AHEAD TO --

*MS. BODIN:* YES, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* I AM INTERESTED IN THE ONES THAT YOU ARE WITHDRAWING, SO IT
IS CLEAR WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, SO LET'S SKIP TO 36.

*MS. BODIN:* YES, YOUR HONOR. NO. 36, THE PEOPLE ARE WITHDRAWING THAT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. BODIN:* INCIDENT NO. 37, THE PEOPLE ARE WITHDRAWING IT.

*THE COURT:* THESE ARE BOTH FROM THE JOURNAL --

*MS. BODIN:* THOSE ARE ACTUALLY STATEMENTS, I BELIEVE, WITH REGARD TO
STALKING AND THAT THE DEFENDANT WOULD KILL HER. WE ARE SEEKING TO
WITHDRAW THAT STATEMENT.

*THE COURT:* OKAY.

*MS. BODIN:* JUDGE'S INCIDENT NO. 43, THAT WILL BE THE FROGMAN INCIDENT,
THE PEOPLE WOULD SEEK TO -- THE PEOPLE ARE WITHDRAWING IT AT THIS POINT.
INCIDENT NO. 44 WE ARE WITHDRAWING. VICTIM NO. 45 -- I MEAN SORRY,
JUDGE'S INCIDENT NO. 45.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. BODIN:* NO. 46. NOW, SKIPPING DOWN TO NO. 49 WITH REGARD TO THE
VICTIM'S REFUSAL TO SEE THE DEFENDANT. WE ARE WITHDRAWING INCIDENT NO.
50. JUDGE'S INCIDENT NO. 51 TO BE WITHDRAWN. AND THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE
INCIDENCES THAT WE HAVE INCLUDED THAT ON THE JUDGE'S LIST, AND YOU ARE
SEEING THEM AT THE BOTTOM, WITH REGARD TO ASHTON STREET AND VICTORIA
BEACH INCIDENTS, AND FINALLY ON THE LAST PAGE WE ARE SEEKING TO INCLUDE,
IT WAS ADDED IN, IT WAS NOT ON YOUR LIST WITH REGARD TO THE SOJOURN
CONTACTS.

*THE COURT:* ALL OF THESE ITEMS THE PEOPLE ARE WITHDRAWING.

*MS. BODIN:* OKAY. THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS BODIN.

*MS. BODIN:* ALL RIGHT. AND THE COURT, AT THE END OF YESTERDAY, AS I HAD
PREVIOUSLY STATED A FEW MOMENTS AGO, HAD QUESTIONED THE PEOPLE WITH
REGARD TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1250 AND THE ENTRANCE OF HEARSAY
STATEMENTS WITH REGARD TO FEAR. THE GENERAL RULE ON THIS IS THAT STATE
OF MIND CAN COME IN WHEN THERE IS CONDUCT IN CONFORMITY AND THERE IS
SOME SORT OF RELEVANCY TO THIS CASE. NOW, WE HAVE STATEMENTS MADE WITH
REGARD TO FEAR, AND SPECIFICALLY THE STATEMENTS NOW THAT I'M HONING IN
ON ARE THESE STATEMENTS AND THESE ARE VERY CLOSE IN TIME TO THE -- TO
THE ACTUAL CRIME. THERE WAS A STATEMENT MADE TO BETSY ROCKETT WHEREIN
THE VICTIM SAID "I'M AFRAID. HE IS PEEPING THROUGH MY WINDOW AND WEARING
DISGUISES," AND THEN THERE ARE STATEMENTS MADE, WHICH WE FOUND OUT ABOUT
YESTERDAY, TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELOR AT SOJOURN STATING THE FEAR
OF THE VICTIM AND THAT HE WAS STALKING HER AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID AND
CONFUSED. THOSE ARE VERY CLOSE IN TIME. THE STATEMENT TO SOJOURN WAS
MADE WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THE ACTUAL KILLING. THE STATEMENT MADE TO BETSY
ROCKETT WAS MADE WITHIN TWO WEEKS -- TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ACTUAL
KILLING. I HAVE TWO ARGUMENTS TO MAKE TO THE COURT THIS MORNING WITH
REGARD TO STATEMENTS OF FEAR. FIRST OF ALL, THOSE STATEMENTS OF FEAR ARE
RELEVANT TO SHOW HOW THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED. THERE WAS A STATEMENT OF
FEAR. AND THE VICTIM WOULD HAVE TO HAVE HAD CONFORMED HER CONDUCT AND
THAT HAS TO BE RELEVANT TO AN ISSUE IN THE CASE. SHE STATED THAT SHE WAS
AFRAID. AND LIKE THE FINCH CASE, IF SHE WAS AFRAID, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE
GONE OUTSIDE ON THE NIGHT THAT THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED. SHE
PARTICULARLY WOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUTSIDE, GIVEN THE DEFENDANT'S
DEMONSTRATED POSSESSIVE RAGE WITH REGARD TO HER INVOLVEMENT WITH OTHER
MEN. WE KNOW THAT MR. GOLDMAN WAS ON HIS WAY TO DELIVER GLASSES. THIS
CRIME -- THIS CRIME AND THE WAY THAT IT WAS COMMITTED SHOWS THAT THE
VICTIM WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE, AND LIKE THE FINCH CASE THAT WE HAVE CITED
IN OUR BRIEF, SHE -- WHAT WE ARE SAYING TO THE COURT IS THAT SHE WOULD
HAVE -- NOT HAVE GONE THERE -- WOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUTSIDE IF SHE HAD
KNOWN THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS OUT THERE, AND THAT IS ON ALL FOURS WITH
THE FINCH CASE, WHERE IN THE FINCH CASE, WHAT THE -- WHAT THE VICTIM IN
THAT CASE DID HAD EXPRESSED FEAR AND THEN WENT BACK TO HER RESIDENCE AND
WAS ULTIMATELY KILLED IN HER RESIDENCE BY THE DEFENDANT. IT IS ON ALL
FOURS WITH FINCH.

*THE COURT:* WITH REGARDS TO THE FACTS, TO SAY THAT IT IS ON ALL FOURS
WITH FINCH, PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE FACTUAL BASIS FOR THAT
ASSERTION I'M NOT CLEAR ON. THE VICTIMS' BODIES WERE FOUND AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE STAIRWAY.

*MS. BODIN:* CORRECT.

*THE COURT:* WHERE IS THAT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE ACTUAL DOORWAY OF THE
CONDOMINIUM BELONGING TO MRS. SIMPSON?

*MS. BODIN:* ABOUT TWENTY FEET.

*THE COURT:* IF YOU RECALL, NONE OF THAT IN PARTICULAR, AS I RECALL, IS
IN EVIDENCE AT THIS POINT.

*MS. BODIN:* NO.

*THE COURT:* OKAY.

*MS. BODIN:* ALL RIGHT. IN ADDITION, WE KNOW THAT THIS CRIME WENT
UNDETECTED FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THAT THERE WAS NO SCREAMING
THAT WAS HEARD BY THE NEIGHBORS, AGAIN SPEAKING TO THE ELEMENT OF
SURPRISE. THE VICTIM EXPRESSED SO MUCH FEAR TO SO MANY PEOPLE AND SO
CLOSE IN TIME TO THE MURDER THAT THESE EXPRESSIONS OF FEAR CAUSED HER TO
ACT IN A CERTAIN WAY THAT IS RELEVANT TO THE WAY THAT THIS CRIME WAS
COMMITTED.

AND THIS IS INFORMATION THAT A JURY SHOULD HEAR TO PERMIT THEM TO MAKE
REASONABLE INFERENCES ABOUT THE WAY THE CRIME OCCURRED. MY SECOND
ARGUMENT WITH REGARD TO EXPRESSIONS OF FEAR RELATE TO ESTRANGEMENT
ARGUMENT AND I THINK THE ISSUE OF ESTRANGEMENT IS CENTRAL TO THIS CASE
BECAUSE AN EXPERT WILL TESTIFY THAT IN A CASE SUCH AS THIS, A DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE CASE, ESTRANGEMENT IS FREQUENTLY A TRIGGER FOR HOMICIDE. THE
ARGUMENT IS THIS: SHE MADE AN EXPRESSION OF FEAR TO SOJOURN. HER FEAR
DROVE HER TO CALL SOJOURN AND MAKE A CONTACT WITH THEM, SOJOURN BEING A
BATTERED WOMAN'S SHELTER AND AN ORGANIZATION THAT EXISTS FOR THE PURPOSE
OF HELPING WOMEN WHO ARE BATTERED. HER CONDUCT WAS IN CONFORMITY WITH
HER FEAR. IT SPEAKS TO ESTRANGEMENT. A PERSON WOULD NOT CALL A SHELTER
BECAUSE THEY WERE HAVING A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR HUSBAND OR THEIR
EX-HUSBAND. THEY WOULD CALL BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEKING TO GET AWAY,
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID, AND SO WE SEE AN ESTRANGEMENT THEME BEGIN. NOW,
THE QUESTION IS HOW IS THIS RELEVANT? SHE IS MANIFESTING ESTRANGEMENT.
WE KNOW THAT IN ANOTHER WAY ALSO. WE KNOW THAT SHE GAVE THE DEFENDANT
BACK A BRACELET THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED FOR HER BIRTHDAY. HE ADMITS THAT
IN HIS STATEMENT TO THE POLICE. IT IS THE PEOPLE'S CONTENTION THAT AT
THE POINT OF THIS ESTRANGEMENT THE DEFENDANT THEN WAS GIVEN A MOTIVE TO
KILL, BECAUSE ESTRANGEMENT IS SHOWN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LITERATURE TO BE THE TRIGGER, THE MOTIVE FOR A KILLING
IN THIS TYPE OF HOMICIDE. AND IN FACT, WHAT AN EXPERT WILL TELL THIS
COURT, AND THIS IS WHY AN EXPERT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR A JURY AND FOR THIS
COURT, IS THAT A WOMAN IS SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED WHEN SHE
LEAVES, AND IN FACT IN HOMICIDES OF THIS TYPE, BY THE END OF TWO MONTHS,
IF A WOMAN IS TO BE KILLED -- IF YOU LOOKED AT A HUNDRED WOMEN WHO WERE
HOMICIDE VICTIMS IN THIS TYPE OF A MURDER, 47 PERCENT OF THEM, 47 OF
THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS.

*THE COURT:* SO LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR ARGUMENT.
YOU ARE ARGUING THAT THE STATEMENT TO A COUNSELOR AT SOJOURN, IF WE CAN
PROVE THAT IT IS IN FACT MRS. SIMPSON WHO MADE THAT CALL --

*MS. BODIN:* CORRECT.

*THE COURT:* -- AND IF YOU CAN ESTABLISH OR DETERMINE THE BRACELET AND
MAKE THE ESTRANGEMENT ARGUMENT, THEN THAT BRINGS IN TESTIMONY THROUGH
BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME. AND COULD YOU TELL US WHAT THAT MEANS?

*MS. BODIN:* HER STATEMENT -- NO, I'M ARGUING 1250 ONLY, BUT THE COURT I
THINK NEEDS TO KNOW TO MAKE ITS RULING WITH REGARD TO 1250 -- NEEDS TO
KNOW WHY THE ESTRANGEMENT ISSUE IS SO IMPORTANT. HER CONDUCT IN CALLING
THE SHELTER INDICATES THAT SHE IS TRYING TO DISTANCE HERSELF FROM THE
DEFENDANT. THIS WAS CLEARLY COMMUNICATED TO THE DEFENDANT WITH THE
RETURN OF THE BRACELET. HER CONDUCT WITH REGARD TO DISTANCING HIM, THE
ESTRANGEMENT, MOTIVATED THIS MURDER. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SAYING.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. GORDON:* SORRY, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* THAT IS ALL RIGHT.

*MS. BODIN:* ESTRANGEMENT IS ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL TO UNDERSTANDING THIS
CASE. IT MOTIVATES THIS MURDER. AND THIS STATEMENT OF FEAR AND HER
CONDUCT IN CONFORMITY WITH HER STATEMENT OF FEAR IS RELEVANT TO THAT
ISSUE OF ESTRANGEMENT WHICH PROVIDES MOTIVE FOR THE DEFENDANT TO KILL.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MY CONCERN THEN IS GIVEN THE EVIDENCE CODE
SECTION THAT INDICATES THE ADMISSIBILITY OF EXPERT TESTIMONY REGARDING
BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME, HAS AN EXPRESS LIMITATION, AN EXPRESS
EXCEPTION WHEN THAT EVIDENCE IS BROUGHT IN TO PROVE THE INCIDENT THAT IS
CHARGED, CORRECT?

*MS. BODIN:* WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME HERE. I
MEAN, GENERALLY WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT IT IN THIS CASE. WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT THE ENTRANCE OF EXPRESSIONS OF FEAR.

*THE COURT:* BUT TO EXPLAIN YOUR ESTRANGEMENT THEORY DON'T YOU HAVE TO
BRING THAT IN THROUGH A BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME EXPERT?

*MS. BODIN:* YES, YOUR HONOR, WE DO, BUT I THINK -- ALSO THINK WITHIN
THE REALM OF COMMON SENSE, WHEN A PERSON IS DISTANCING -- DISTANCING
THEMSELVES FROM AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS EXPRESSED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN A
LONG-TIME RELATIONSHIP, AND THE CASES DEMONSTRATE THIS, THAT THEY WISH
TO BASICALLY CONTROL THIS PERSON, TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THEM, TO POSSESS
THEM, TO BE JEALOUS OF THEM, ACTS OF ESTRANGEMENT ARE FREQUENTLY MOTIVES
FOR MURDER.

*THE COURT:* CAN YOU CITE ME TO A CASE ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES
THAT ALLOWS THAT?

*MS. BODIN:* YOUR HONOR, THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE CASES WITH REGARD TO
POSSESSIVENESS AND JEALOUSY THAT ARE STATED IN OUR BRIEF.

*THE COURT:* POSSESSIVENESS AND JEALOUSY ARE THINGS THAT ARE RELATIVELY
COMMON. THIS THEORY OF ESTRANGEMENT --

*MS. BODIN:* THE DISTANCING --

*THE COURT:* I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, BUT I'M SAYING
WITH REGARD TO YOUR SPECIFIC THOUGHT PROCESS, IS THERE ANY CASE THAT YOU
ARE AWARE OF ANYWHERE IN ANY JURISDICTION THAT INDICATES THIS THEORY?

*MS. BODIN:* CAN I HAVE JUST A MOMENT?

*THE COURT:* SURE.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. BODIN:* WELL, YOUR HONOR, I WOULD ASK THE COURT TO LOOK AT THE CASE
OF PEOPLE VERSUS DE MOSS, WHICH WE HAVE CITED IN OUR BRIEF, WHERE THE
DEFENDANT WAS HEARD TO SAY, "IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NOBODY ELSE WILL."

*THE COURT:* BUT I THINK THAT THAT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS TO A TRIER OF FACT
WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ESTRANGEMENT THEORY.

*MS. BODIN:* YOUR HONOR, I THINK THAT SHE MAKES A STATEMENT OF FEAR. SHE
CALLS -- SHE CALLS A SHELTER. CLEARLY PEOPLE DON'T CALL SHELTERS BECAUSE
THEY WANT TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH SOMEBODY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS
THE DEFENDANT'S REACTION TO THIS DISTANCING, EVEN IF WE DON'T CALL IT
ESTRANGEMENT? WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL IT, SHE WANTS TO DISTANCE HERSELF
FROM HIM. HER CONDUCT IS RELEVANT TO SOMETHING THAT HE DID LATER; HE
KILLED HER, AND HE KILLED HER BECAUSE SHE WAS DISTANCING HERSELF FROM
HIM AFTER HE EXPRESSED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT, YOU KNOW, IF I
-- I CAN'T LET HER GO. I MEAN, HE SAID THAT. HE SAID THAT TO THE MOTHER
OF THE VICTIM, I CAN'T LET HER GO, AND THE POINT THAT SHE TRIES TO MAKE
HIM GO, TO MAKE HIM LET GO, THAT IS MOTIVATION FOR KILLING.

*THE COURT:* YOU ARE WITHDRAWING THAT ONE, HOWEVER.

*MS. BODIN:* I DON'T BELIEVE WE DID, YOUR HONOR, AND IF WE DID, IT WAS
NOT INTENTIONAL.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MR. GORDON:* NO. 41.

*MS. BODIN:* IT IS NO. 41, THE DEFENDANT WAS THE ONLY WOMAN HE WANTED.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. BODIN:* YOUR HONOR, I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT WE KNOW
ABOUT ESTRANGEMENT THEORIES, ABOUT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, BUT WE ALSO KNOW
ABOUT, ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T CALL IT ESTRANGEMENT THEORIES, SUCH AS A CASE
LIKE DE MOSS, WHERE THIS KIND OF DISTANCING, IF I CAN'T HAVE HER NOBODY
ELSE WILL, DOES PROVIDE A MOTIVE FOR MURDER. AND THE CASE LAW IS PRETTY
CLEAR ON THAT AND DE MOSS IS CITED IN OUR BRIEF. DOES THE COURT HAVE ANY
QUESTIONS FURTHER FOR ME WITH REGARD TO 1250?

*THE COURT:* NO. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR ARGUMENT IS.

*MS. BODIN:* OKAY. AND FINALLY, THE COURT HAD AGAIN AT THE END OF
YESTERDAY ASKED US TO BASICALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT SOME OF OUR THEORIES
WITH WERE REGARD TO ADMISSIBILITY. I'M NOT GOING TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS
THE HEARSAY DISCUSSIONS, BUT I THINK I COVERED THAT PRETTY CLEARLY
YESTERDAY, UNLESS THE COURT HAS QUESTIONS FOR ME ON THAT.

*THE COURT:* NOT ON THE EXCITED UTTERANCE. THE CASE LAW IS PRETTY CLEAR.

*MS. BODIN:* AND I THINK OUR BRIEF IS PRETTY CLEAR ON THAT. HOWEVER, THE
COURT I THINK ASKED ME, WELL, WHAT IS THE BIG PICTURE HERE? THAT IS THE
QUESTION THAT THE COURT IS ASKING ME, WHAT DOES ALL THIS EVIDENCE MEAN?
THERE IS A BIG PICTURE AND THERE IS A LITTLE PICTURE. THE LITTLE PICTURE
I THINK IS THAT THE ACTS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, THE STATEMENTS MADE
BY THE DEFENDANT, FALL INTO SIX BASIC CATEGORIES.

AND THE FIRST CATEGORY IS OBSESSIVE AND JEALOUS BEHAVIOR. FOR EXAMPLE,
THE INCIDENTS THAT WE HAVE CITED TO THE COURT WITH REGARD TO OBSESSIVE
AND JEALOUS BEHAVIOR. HE SHOWS UP AT RESTAURANTS. SHE IS STILL MY WIFE.
IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NOBODY ELSE CAN HAVE HER. THE INCIDENTS THAT I HAVE
CITED WITH THE COURT ARE REPLETE WITH OBSESSIVENESS TO THE POINT WHERE
HE IS LOOKING IN HER WINDOW TO SEE WHAT SHE IS DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT. THERE IS A CASE -- THERE ARE CASES WITH REGARD TO
OBSESSIVENESS, OBSESSING, RATHER, JEALOUSY AND POSSESSIVENESS. ONE OF
THEM I CITED TO THE COURT WHICH IS DE MOSS WHICH IS CONTAINED WITHIN OUR
BRIEF, IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, NOBODY ELSE WILL. THERE IS THE SHAVER CASE,
WHICH IS CITED IN OUR BRIEF, WHERE THE DEFENDANT IN THAT CASE HAD
ACCUSED THE VICTIM OF BEING WITH OTHER MEN. THERE IS THE CARTIER CASE,
ONCE AGAIN A CASE ON JEALOUSY, AND THE DANIELS CASE WHICH IS ALSO A CASE
INVOLVING JEALOUSY. AND WHAT THE COURTS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SAID IN THOSE
FOUR CASES IS THAT POSSESSIVENESS AND JEALOUSY PROVIDE A MOTIVE FOR
MURDER. SECONDLY, AND THE NEXT CATEGORY, ARE EMOTIONAL AND -- ARE
EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND PUBLIC HUMILIATION, AND THERE IS A CASE ON THAT, THE
CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS DANIELS, WHICH I HAVE JUST CITED TO THE COURT,
WHERE THERE IS A HISTORY OF ENMITY AND QUARRELS WHERE THERE IS BASICALLY
PUBLIC ABUSE GOING ON AND THAT PROVIDES A MOTIVE ALSO FOR MURDER.
PROPERTY DESTRUCTION. THERE IS LOTS OF PROPERTY DESTRUCTION INCIDENTS
CONTAINED WITHIN THE FACTS THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT TO THE COURT. WE
HAVE A CAR THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED, WE HAVE DOORS THAT ARE KICKED IN, WE
HAVE PICTURES THAT ARE WRECKED.

*THE COURT:* SLOW DOWN. SLOW DOWN.

*MS. BODIN:* OKAY. AND THERE ARE TWO CASES CITED IN OUR BRIEF, HELFEND
AND HAYLOCK, BOTH OF THOSE INVOLVING ARSON. ONE OF THEM, INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH, INVOLVING THE ARSON OF A CAR, THAT WOULD BE THE HAYLOCK CASE,
AND ONCE AGAIN THE COURT HAS SAID THAT THAT PROVIDES A MOTIVE AND A --
FOR A PERMISSIBLE 1101(B) PURPOSE. THERE ARE CASES ON STALKING, AND
INTERESTINGLY, THERE IS A CASE ON STALKING AND STARING THAT TALKS ABOUT
STALKING AND STARING AND FOLLOWING AS BEING ADMISSIBLE ON THE ISSUE OF
PREMEDITATION, AND THAT IS THE NICHOLAUS CASE WHICH IS CITED IN OUR
BRIEF. PHYSICAL VIOLENCE REALLY IS TAKEN UP IN THE ZACK CASE. IT IS ALSO
TAKEN UP I BELIEVE IN THE DANIELS CASE. IN ZACK IT WAS ADMISSIBLE ON THE
ISSUE OF IDENTITY. IN DANIELS IT WAS ADMISSIBLE ON THE ISSUE OF MOTIVE.
I MIGHT ALSO ADD THAT THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT MADE BY MR. UELMEN YESTERDAY
THAT NONE OF THE ACTS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE ARE SIMILAR TO THE CRIME THAT
WAS COMMITTED, AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT IF THEY HAD TO BE
EXACTLY SIMILAR -- AND SIMILARITY, BY THE WAY, IS NOT THE TEST AND I
WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT -- WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IS THAT THE
DEFENDANT WOULD HAVE HAD TO KILL THE VICTIM TWICE. SINCE WE KNOW THAT IS
NOT POSSIBLE, THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THE STANDARD AND ZACK TALKS ABOUT
THAT. FINALLY, WITH REGARD TO FINANCIAL MANIPULATION, AND THERE ARE
INCIDENTS WITH REGARD TO FINANCIAL MANIPULATION AND THERE IS TWO OF
THEM. THE FIRST ONE IS A PRENUPTIAL LETTER WHERE BASICALLY THE DEFENDANT
SAYS, WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THIS EVER HAPPENS AGAIN THIS PRENUPTIAL
AGREEMENT IS VOID, USING IT AS A TOOL TO KEEP HER CLOSE TO HIM. OKAY,
I'M NEVER GOING TO DO THIS AGAIN, IT IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.
HERE, I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN WRITING, THIS IS A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT.
THAT IS FINANCIAL MANIPULATION. HE ALSO, TOWARD THE END OF THEIR
RELATIONSHIP, CLOSE TO THE TIME WHEN HE KILLED THE VICTIM, HE SENT A
LETTER TO HER WITH REGARD TO REPORTING HER TO THE IRS, AGAIN ATTEMPTING
TO MANIPULATE HER, TO THREATEN HER THROUGH FINANCIAL MEANS, AND THERE IS
A CASE ON THAT AND THAT IS THE CASE OF ARGENTOS. THAT, INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH, INVOLVED GOLDMINERS, AND WHAT THE COURT SAID IS EVIDENCE OF
FINANCIAL MANIPULATION IS ADMISSIBLE ON THE ISSUE OF MOTIVE. CLEARLY
THESE CASES ARE NOT LIMITED MERELY TO PHYSICAL ASSAULT. WE ARE NOT JUST
TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL ASSAULT HERE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LARGE
PATTERN OF ABUSIVE ACTS, NOT JUST PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE ACTS. THERE ARE
MANY WAYS THAT YOU CAN ABUSE SOMEBODY. YOU CAN ABUSE THEM BY TRYING TO
MANIPULATE THEM FINANCIALLY, AS I HAVE JUST SAID, BY RUINING THEIR
PROPERTY, IMPORTANT PROPERTY, PICTURES, THINGS THAT PEOPLE HOLD NEAR AND
DEAR TO THEIR HEART. AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE BIG PICTURE AND THE BIG
PICTURE IS EWOLDT. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING YESTERDAY THAT THE
DEFENSE CITED EWOLDT AND MADE IT LOOK LIKE THAT WAS A CASE THAT WAS GOOD
FOR THE DEFENSE. IT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE DEFENSE. IT IS A WONDERFUL CASE
FOR THE PEOPLE ON COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN. AND IN THAT COURT THE
LET IN EVIDENCE OF COMMON SCHEME AND DESIGN AND WE HAVE CITED THAT IN
OUR BRIEF. AND MR. GOLDBERG IS GOING TO TALK IN GREAT DEPTH ABOUT THE
EWOLDT COURT; HOWEVER, I WILL SAY THIS TO THE COURT, THAT THE COMMON
PLAN, THE MONDAY DESIGN OF ALL THESE ACTS IS TO CONTROL AND TO DOMINATE
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON.

IF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE DOESN'T WORK, WELL, LET'S TRY A LITTLE FINANCIAL
MANIPULATION. WELL, IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, HEY, LET'S USE A LITTLE
PROPERTY DESTRUCTION. IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, WELL, MAYBE I WILL START
FOLLOWING HER AROUND AND SHOWING UP EVERYWHERE SHE GOES, SHOW UP AT
RESTAURANTS AND SHOWS UP AT HER HOUSE. AND HE HAS SEEN BY MANY PEOPLE
DOING THIS; THE COLBYS, KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH, JEFFREY KELLER, PEOPLE WHO
ARE SEEING HIM FOLLOWING HER WHEREVER SHE GOES, IN HER HOME, IN HER
RESTAURANT, CALLING HER. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOES SHOW A
COMMON PLAN TO CONTROL HER, AND WHEN HE FINALLY COULDN'T CONTROL HER,
WHEN SHE WAS FINALLY BREAKING AWAY FROM HIM, WHEN SHE HAD FINALLY
ESTRANGED HERSELF FROM HIM AND TRIED TO DISTANCE HERSELF FROM HIM, IT IS
THE PEOPLE'S CONTENTION THAT HE KILLED HER. AND ALL OF THESE ACTS
PROVIDE POWERFUL MOTIVE AND SPEAK LOUDLY TO THE ISSUE OF IDENTITY AND
THAT IS WHAT ZACK SAYS. ZACK SAYS, LOOK, LET'S JUST LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.
IF THERE IS A PAST HISTORY OF QUARRELS AND ABUSE AND ENMITY, THAT COMES
IN FOR THE ISSUE OF IDENTITY. THAT IS THE PLAIN MEANING OF ZACK.

AND THE OTHER THING THAT ZACK SAYS, AND I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT,
ZACK SAYS THIS: "NO DEFENDANT IS ENTITLED TO MAKE A REPRESENTATION TO A
JURY THAT THEIR PARTING WAS PEACEFUL AND FRIENDLY, WAS DEVOID OF
CONFLICT WHEN IN FACT THERE WAS A LONG HISTORY," AS IN THIS CASE, "OF
ABUSE ON MANY LEVELS." AND THAT IS THE TRUTH OF THIS CASE AND ALL OF
THESE ACTS OF ABUSE STARTING IN 1977 PROVE A LONG AND VIOLENT HISTORY
AND THAT IS THE RELEVANCE. IT SHOWS A PATTERN.

*THE COURT:* MISS BODIN, LET ME ASK YOU THIS THEN: THE ZACK CASE APPEARS
TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR STRATEGY AND REASONING FOR THE
ADMISSIBILITY OF THIS HISTORY, AND MY CONCERN IS THAT ZACK, ALTHOUGH IT
IS NOT CLEAR FROM THE RECORD OF ZACK, THE ACTUAL WRITTEN OPINION IS NOT
CLEAR, THE INFERENCE IS THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO ADMIT
THAT ZACK DID ALLOW WAS ALLOWED IN REBUTTAL AFTER THE DEFENDANT HAD
TESTIFIED. THE REASON I FEEL RELATIVELY CONFIDENT IN THAT ANALYSIS OF
THE ZACK CASE IS THAT ZACK IS CITED IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT
CASES FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT THIS IS ADMISSIBLE IN REBUTTAL.

YOU ARE ASKING ME TO ALLOW THIS EVIDENCE IN IN THE PEOPLE'S CASE IN
CHIEF, WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN WHAT WE FACE
HERE TODAY, AND I DON'T KNOW THAT ZACK IS NECESSARILY A GOOD FOUNDATION
FOR THAT REASON.

*MS. BODIN:* I UNDERSTAND THE COURT'S QUESTION AND THAT IS A VERY
NATURAL BREAK INTO MR. GOLDBERG'S ARGUMENT, BECAUSE HE IS THE PERSON WHO
WILL BE PRESENTING THE ARGUMENTS UNDER ZACK AND THE ANALYSIS UNDER ZACK.
AND AT THIS POINT I WILL GIVE WAY THE PODIUM TO MR. GOLDBERG.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* GOOD MORNING, COUNSEL.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* MR. UELMEN STARTED HIS ARGUMENT YESTERDAY BY TELLING US
A STORY ABOUT HOW WHEN HE WAS A PROSECUTOR HE AFFIXED A LABEL TO HIS
VARIOUS CASE FILES, THEN I THINK HE SAID ORGANIZED CRIME, AND WOULD
DISPLAY IT IN SUCH A WAY SO THAT IT WAS VERY VISIBLE AS HE CARRIED THE
CASE FILE AROUND. AND I TOOK THAT STORY AS PERHAPS YOUR HONOR DID, AS AN
APOCRYPHAL KIND OF STORY THAT WAS DESIGNED TO INDICATE THE MISCHIEF THAT
CAN BE CAUSED BY FIXING LABELS TO THINGS IMPROPERLY. THE STORY DID,
HOWEVER, CAUSE ME TO LOOK AT MY CASE FILE, THE SAME ONE THAT I BROUGHT
DOWN WITH ME TO COURT TO CONTAIN MY ARGUMENTS AND SOME OF THE SUPPORTING
DOCUMENTS, AND I NOTICED THAT I ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY LABEL ON IT AT
ALL. THE PROSECUTION HAS NOT LABELED THIS CASE. THE PROSECUTION DID NOT
TELL THE DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE TO ENGAGE IN A PATTERN OF ABUSE AGAINST
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON OVER A PERIOD OF 17 YEARS. THE PROSECUTION DID NOT
TELL THE DEFENDANT TO COMMIT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMICIDE. HE DID THOSE
THINGS BY HIMSELF. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY LABEL ATTACHES TO THIS CASE,
HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT LABEL. WE DID NOT CREATE THE EVIDENCE. WE
SIMPLY TAKE THE CASE AS WE GET IT, AND IT HAPPENS TO BE THAT THAT IS THE
KIND OF A CASE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE. NOW, IT WAS OUR POSITION
IN OUR MOVING PAPERS, AND IT IS OUR POSITION TODAY, THAT THERE IS A
PARTICULAR RULE OF ADMISSIBILITY THAT PERTAINS IN THOSE KIND OF CASES,
THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT MOTIVE ANALYSIS, IF YOU WILL, WITH RESPECT TO
THE ADMISSIBILITY OF OTHER CRIMES EVIDENCE IN THIS TYPE OF A CASE, AND
IT IS VERY WELL-DOCUMENTED IN CALIFORNIA CASE LAW. I AM GOING TO DISCUSS
THAT WITH YOU TODAY AND I'M GOING TO DISCUSS PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK, AS I
KNOW YOUR HONOR WANTS ME TO.

IN THE SECOND PART OF MY ARGUMENT I WANT TO TURN TO A MORE TRADITIONAL
1101(B) ANALYSIS AND SHOW THAT THIS EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE FOR THE
PURPOSES OF SHOWING INTENT, IDENTITY, COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN
UNDER A MORE TRADITIONAL TYPE OF APPROACH. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT A
LITTLE LATER ON THE THIRD PART OF MY ARGUMENT ABOUT THE DUE PROCESS
ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE. ALTHOUGH COUNSEL DID NOT REPEAT IT YESTERDAY,
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER HE IS WITHDRAWING THAT. AND FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE
TO DISCUSS EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 352 AND WHY IT IS THAT THE EVIDENCE IS
NOT EXCLUDABLE UNDER THAT SECTION. NOW, FIRST IT IS OUR POSITION, AS WE
SAID, THAT THERE IS A RULE BASED ON COMMON SENSE, BASED ON LAW, THAT IN
RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES THE JURY MUST HEAR EVIDENCE REGARDING THE
RELATIONSHIP. THAT IS ABOUT AS SUCCINCTLY AS I CAN PUT IT. AND THIS
NOTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR OF SAYING THAT THERE IS A
DIFFERENT MOTIVE ANALYSIS THAT YOU APPLY IN THIS KIND OF A CASE IS NOT
IN IN WAY NOVEL, BECAUSE IN FACT THE COURT IN PEOPLE VERSUS SALAZAR,
WHICH WE CITED IN OUR BRIEF, SAID THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF SEX OFFENSE
CASES, QUOTE:

"IN SEX OFFENSE CASES OUR SUPREME COURT HAS SET FORTH A LESS STRINGENT
TEST FOR ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE OF UNCHARGED OFFENSES," END QUOTE, "WHEN
THE PRIOR OFFENSE INVOLVED THE SAME VICTIM AND THE SAME DEFENDANT." SO
IT IS A VERY ANALOGOUS SITUATION. AND THE POINT IS THAT WHEN WE EXAMINE
CALIFORNIA CASE LAW, WE SEE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE THERE
ARE RELATIVELY WELL-DEFINED RULES ALMOST OF BLACK LETTER ADMISSIBILITY
WITH RESPECT TO THE ADMISSIONS OF PRIOR CRIMES EVIDENCE. THE SEX OFFENSE
CASES INVOLVING SITUATIONS WHERE THE PRIOR INSTANCES INVOLVE THE SAME
DEFENDANT AND THE SAME VICTIM ARE ONE. WE ARE TELLING THE COURT THAT THE
CALIFORNIA CASE LAW CLEARLY INDICATES THAT RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES
IS ANOTHER, AND IT IS NOT SIMPLY BASED ON PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK, BUT RATHER
A NUMBER OF CASES, AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THOSE AS WELL. BUT BEFORE
GETTING INTO THAT RATHER DENSE LEGAL ANALYSIS, AND I THINK IT IS
NECESSARY, IN LIGHT OF COUNSEL'S ARGUMENT AND SOME OF THE COURT'S
QUESTIONS, I JUST WANTED TO FIRST DISCUSS FROM A COMMON SENSE
PERSPECTIVE WHY IT IS THAT THIS PARTICULAR RULE EXISTS AND GIVE SOME
HYPOTHETICALS IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE IT. WHERE SOMEONE KILLS ANOTHER
PERSON WITH WHOM THEY WERE INVOLVED IN A RELATIONSHIP, IT SEEMS THAT THE
FIRST QUESTION THAT THE LOGICAL MIND IS GOING TO ASK IS WHAT WAS THE
RELATIONSHIP, WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP, WHAT WAS GOING ON
IN THE RELATIONSHIP? THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE FIRST QUESTIONS THAT ANY
JURY WOULD ASK IN ANY KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE, AND THAT IS
WHY WE HAVE AN ENTIRE BODY OF CASE LAW IN THIS STATE THAT GOVERNS
ADMISSIBILITY ISSUES IN THAT CONTEXT. NOW, WHY FROM A COMMON SENSE
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE RULE? WHY WOULD THERE BE A SPECIAL SET OF RULES
OR AT LEAST A WHOLE BODY OF CASE LAW DEVOTED TO THIS AREA? WELL, LET'S
SAY, YOUR HONOR, THAT IN THIS CASE OR IN ANY MURDER CASE INVOLVING A
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDER OR A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE MURDER, THE
DEFENDANT WANTED TO PUT ON EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT HE GOT ALONG VERY WELL
WITH THE VICTIM, THEY WERE VERY CLOSE, THEY HELD HANDS, THEY WERE
AFFECTIONATE WITH ONE ANOTHER, HE CALLED FRIENDS AND PEOPLE TO
CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP IN THAT WAY. WOULDN'T THAT CLEARLY BE
ADMISSIBLE WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY 1101 ANALYSIS? IT IS NOT CHARACTER
EVIDENCE; IT IS JUST EVIDENCE CHARACTERIZING A RELATIONSHIP.

AND IF YOUR HONOR CAN IMAGINE THE REVERSE OF THAT SCENARIO, THE
PROSECUTION PUTTING ON EVIDENCE THAT TWO PEOPLE WERE ESTRANGED, DISTANT,
THAT THEY QUARRELED, THAT THEY WERE SPLITTING APART, PERHAPS THAT THE
HUSBAND HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, WOULDN'T THAT CLEARLY BE
RELEVANT TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP? AND AGAIN, IT IS NOT REALLY
1101(B) EVIDENCE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT; IT IS JUST EVIDENCE WHICH
CHARACTERIZES AND EXPLAINS THE DYNAMIC OF THAT RELATIONSHIP. NOW, I
WOULD LIKE THE COURT TO IMAGINE ANOTHER HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION AND THAT
WOULD BE A CASE WHERE THE VICTIM HAS BATTERED THE DEFENDANT OR ABUSED
THE DEFENDANT, BECAUSE COMMONLY WE THINK OF THAT NOW UNDER SOME MODERN
APPROACHES THAT ARE USED IN OUR COURTS AS BEING DEFENSE EVIDENCE THAT
WOULD NEGATE MURDER TO MANSLAUGHTER POTENTIALLY UNDER AN HONEST BUT
UNREASONABLE BELIEF IN SELF-DEFENSE. BUT THOUGHT OF ANOTHER WAY IT COULD
ALSO BE VERY POWERFUL PROSECUTION EVIDENCE. IT COULD BE EVIDENCE THAT
CLEARLY INDICATES WHY THE DEFENDANT HAD A MOTIVE TO KILL HIS ABUSER OR
HER ABUSER. AND IF THE EVIDENCE DID NOT INDICATE AN IMMINENT FEAR, IT
WOULD BE VERY POWERFUL EVIDENCE OF A FIRST DEGREE MURDER. IS THAT
1101(B) EVIDENCE? OF COURSE NOT. IT IS NOT CHARACTER EVIDENCE. IT IS
SIMPLY EVIDENCE WHICH CHARACTERIZES A RELATIONSHIP AND SHOWS THE DYNAMIC
IN THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT ALLOWED A MURDER TO HAPPEN. NOW, THOUGHT OF
THAT WAY, THE EVIDENCE THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN, RELATIONSHIP EVIDENCE
ISN'T REALLY IN MANY SENSES 1101(B) EVIDENCE, IT IS NOT CHARACTER
EVIDENCE, BY RATHER SIMPLY TRANSACTIONAL EVIDENCE TO SHOW WHAT THE
DEVELOPMENT WAS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP, WHAT THE CHARACTERISTICS WERE IN
THAT RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN HOW THE HOMICIDE OCCURRED. NOW,
THIS RULE THAT I HAVE JUST CITED OR THAT I HAVE JUST ARGUED FROM THE
COMMON SENSE PERSPECTIVE WAS PUT FORWARD VERY SUCCINCTLY IN THE CASE OF
PEOPLE VERSUS HELFEND WHICH WAS A CASE WHERE A DEFENDANT MURDERED HIS
EX-WIFE'S HUSBAND. AND THERE WAS A HISTORY AND A PATTERN OF HARASSMENT
IN THAT CASE. FOUR YEARS PRIOR TO THE HOMICIDE HE HAD BURNT DOWN THE
VICTIM'S HOME. THIS IS ONE OF THE CASES THAT MISS BODIN CITED FOR THE
PROPOSITION THAT PROPERTY DESTRUCTION IS RELEVANT IN A DOMESTIC -- IN A
RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE, AND HERE IS WHAT THE COURT SAID. QUOTE:
"WHEN THE MOTIVE OF A CRIME IS SOUGHT TO BE ESTABLISHED BEFORE A JURY,
THE WHOLE CONDUCT, LIFE AND CHARACTER OF THE PARTIES AS AFFECTING THIS
QUESTION IS OPEN TO INQUIRY." WELL, THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I'M SAYING,
YOUR HONOR, THAT WHERE THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP. WE HAVE TO OPEN THAT UP
RELATIONSHIP, EXAMINE IT, FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON FOR THE PURPOSES OF
DETERMINING WHY THAT MURDER OCCURRED. SO EVEN IF PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK
WASN'T IN EXISTENCE, OF COURSE I WOULD STILL BE ASKING FOR THE EVIDENCE
TO BE ADMITTED UNDER PEOPLE VERSUS HELFEND AND MANY OF THE OTHER CASES
THAT WAVE CITED IN OUR BRIEF. NOW, THE DEFENSE POSITION APPEARS TO BE
THAT WE CANNOT OFFER EVIDENCE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP, THAT WE ARE NOT
ENTITLED TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP. I WAS -- I DID NOT
UNDERSTAND, UNTIL YESTERDAY, THE EXACT POSITION THAT THEY WERE TAKING ON
THIS ISSUE. IN TRYING TO ANTICIPATE THE ARGUMENTS, I WASN'T SURE WHETHER
COUNSEL WAS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE
RELATIONSHIP AT ALL OR WHETHER THEY WERE GOING TO PROPOSE SOME KIND OF
SANITIZED VERSION OF THE RELATIONSHIP. AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN WHAT
I MEAN ABOUT THAT. LET'S IMAGINE THAT WE TRIED THE CASE, YOUR HONOR,
WITHOUT TELLING THE JURY THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS EVER MARRIED TO
THE DEFENDANT, WAS JUST A WOMAN WHO WAS MURDERED. RONALD GOLDMAN WAS
JUST A MAN THAT WAS MURDERED, AND WE DID NOT TELL THEM OF THE EXISTENCE
OF ANY RELATIONSHIP AT ALL. IT IS ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE, BECAUSE THE JURY
WOULD HAVE TO CALL INTO QUESTION ALL OF OUR EVIDENCE, NO MATTER HOW
STRONG IT WAS, POINTING TO THE DEFENDANT AS THE MURDERER, BECAUSE WHY ON
EARTH WOULD ORENTHAL SIMPSON KILL AN ENTIRE STRANGER, JUST THIS WOMAN
NAMED NICOLE OR THIS MAN THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND DIDN'T KNOW
AND WHY WOULD HE HAVE KILLED THEM SO BRUTALLY? IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY
SENSE AND IT WOULD UNDERMINE THE PROSECUTION'S CASE, CLEARLY. IT IS ONLY
WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP AND YOU UNDERSTAND THE JEALOUSY,
THE POSSESSIVENESS, THAT THE KILLING AND THE BRUTALITY OF THE KILLING OF
NICOLE MAKES SENSE. IT IS ONLY WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE JEALOUSY AND THE
POSSESSIVENESS THAT IT BECOMES UNDERSTANDABLE WHY ON EARTH HE WOULD KILL
THIS YOUNG MAN WHO HE HAD PROBABLY ONLY SEEN ON ONE OCCASION BEFORE,
THAT WOULD BE IN THE INCIDENT INVOLVING STARBUCK'S COFFEE. WHY WOULD HE
KILL THEM? IT BECOMES UNDERSTANDABLE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE JEALOUSY. THE
DEFENDANT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE KNOW. HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE HAD BEEN A
CALL PLACED TO MEZZALUNA TO RETURN THE GLASSES. HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT MR.
GOLDMAN WAS HOLDING THE GLASSES. HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE HAD HIS CAR KEYS
IN HIS HAND, THAT HE WAS GOING TO DROP THEM OFF AND LEAVE. TO HIM THIS
WAS A MAN WHO AT NIGHT, UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE BELIEVED TO BE VERY
SUSPICIOUS, A POTENTIAL SUITOR WAS MEETING SOMEONE THAT HE HAD A
POSSESSORY INTEREST IN AND THAT EXPLAINS WHY HE KILLED HIM, THE
BRUTALITY OF IT. IN YOU SIMPLY SANITIZE IT TO THE POINT OF SAYING THERE
WAS NO RELATIONSHIP, THAT CLEARLY WOULD BE THE PERPETRATION OF A FRAUD
ON THE JURY. IT CLEARLY WOULD BE HIGHLY, HIGHLY MISLEADING. BUT WHAT THE
DEFENSE POSITION APPEARS TO BE, IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THEM, IS NOT THAT
WE HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP AT ALL, BUT WE HAVE TO
SANITIZE IT, GIVING THEM WHAT I THINK THE DEFENSE WOULD PROBABLY
CHARACTERIZE AS NEUTRAL HISTORICAL FACTS. THEY GOT MARRIED ON A CERTAIN
DATE, THEY SEPARATED ON A CERTAIN DATE, THEY DIVORCED ON A CERTAIN DATE,
THEY TRIED TO RECONCILE AND THAT DIDN'T WORK. THEY BROKE UP. I THINK
THAT THAT IS -- THAT THEY ARE SAYING THAT THAT IS ABOUT THE EXTENT TO
WHICH WE CAN EXPLAIN THIS RELATIONSHIP. BUT WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOUR
HONOR IS THAT THE TERMS THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY CONCEDE THAT WE COULD
USE, THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY CONCEDE WE COULD USE, DOESN'T
SOLVE THE PROBLEM, IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY LESS OF A MISLEADING SCENARIO,
BECAUSE THE TERM "HUSBAND AND WIFE," THOSE AREN'T NEUTRAL TERMS. THEY DO
IMPLY SOMETHING. THEY IMPLY LOVE, THEY IMPLY FIDELITY, THEY IMPLY THAT
THIS MAN AT LEAST AT ONE TIME TOOK AN OATH THAT HE WOULD HONOR, THAT HE
WOULD PROTECT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, AND A JURY IS ENTITLED TO DRAW THAT
INFERENCE AND WILL DRAW THAT INFERENCE FROM THAT KIND OF EVIDENCE. IN
OTHER WORDS, WHAT THEY WILL DRAW IS INFERENCES ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP
WHICH ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE KNOW THE TRUTH TO BE. AND I
BELIEVE, YOUR HONOR, THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE COURT IN PEOPLE
VERSUS ZACK WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY SAID THAT THE DEFENDANT IS NOT
ENTITLED TO HAVE THE JURY DETERMINE HIS GUILT OR INNOCENCE ON A FALSE
PRESENTATION THAT HIS AND THE VICTIM'S RELATIONSHIP AND THEIR PARTING
WERE PEACEFUL AND FRIENDLY, BECAUSE THAT IS THE KIND OF INFERENCE, WHICH
IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY EVIDENCE, YOU WOULD DRAW AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT
ZACK IS SAYING IN THE QUOTE. BY THE WAY, THAT IS ALL I THINK THEY ARE
SAYING IN THAT QUOTE AND I WILL DISCUSS THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE LATER ON.
THAT IS WHY THE PROSECUTION SAYS, AND IT IS NOT OVERSTATING OUR
POSITION, THAT NOT TO ALLOW THIS EVIDENCE IS NOT MERELY TO DEPRIVE THE
JURY OF RELEVANT EVIDENCE, IT IS TO DO SOMETHING MUCH WORSE. IT IS TO
GIVE THEM JUST ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO INFER THINGS THAT ARE A HUNDRED AND
EIGHTY DEGREES DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED FROM THE TRUTH. THAT IS, IT IS
TRULY AS WE SAID, TO PERPETRATE A FRAUD ON THE JURY, AND THE CALIFORNIA
CASE LAW DOES NOT PERMIT THAT. NOW, WE SAY THAT THIS RULE THAT WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT IS ESTABLISHED BY PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO
ALSO STATE, BECAUSE COUNSEL ARGUED THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY CASE WE WERE
RELYING ON -- IT IS NOT THE ONLY CASE WE ARE RELYING ON. THE REASON THAT
WE RELIED SO HEAVILY ON ZACK IS BASICALLY TWO-FOLD. NO. 1, IT IS MY
FEELING, AS THE FEELING OF MANY PROSECUTORS OR ATTORNEYS IN GENERAL,
THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE CASE THAT REALLY TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT
THE LAW AND CLEARLY TELLS YOU THAT, YOU CAN CITE THAT ONE CASE AND THAT
IS PRETTY MUCH ALL YOU NEED TO DO. THE LESS IS MORE TYPE OF APPROACH TO
ADVOCACY. AS YOUR HONOR KNOWS BY READING OUR BRIEF, THAT WAS NOT THE
APPROACH THAT WE TOOK HERE AND WE DID NOT TAKE THAT APPROACH HERE
BECAUSE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY COUNSEL IN HIS BRIEF AND
BECAUSE OF THE ARGUMENTS -- WHAT HE SAID IS HE SAID ZACK IS WRONG IN A
FOOTNOTE TO HIS BRIEF, SO WHAT WE FELT THAT HE HAD TO DO IS WE NEEDED TO
BACK UP ALL THE WAY TO 1909, WALK ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO ZACK AND WALK
FROM ZACK FORWARD TO PEOPLE VERSUS NICHOLAUS, ALL OF THESE BEING
RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES, AND SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE THE RULES COME
FROM AND EXACTLY WHY THIS RULE IS IN FACT CORRECT.

ON PAGE 27 THROUGH 33 OF OUR BRIEF WE DISCUSSED TEN RELATIONSHIP
VIOLENCE CASES. NOT ONE, TEN. COUNSEL SAYS WE ONLY RELIED ON ONE. WE
HAVE TEN IN THERE. MOST OF THOSE CASES ARE CASES WHERE A HUSBAND KILLED
A WIFE OR A BOYFRIEND KILLED A GIRLFRIEND -- A BOYFRIEND KILLED A
GIRLFRIEND. ONE OF THE CASES IS WHERE A GIRLFRIEND KILLED A BOYFRIEND.
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF AUTHORITY ON THIS ISSUE AND A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE
AND HOLDINGS OF THOSE CASES ARE EVERY BIT AS PERSUASIVE AS THE ZACK CASE
ITSELF, AND IN FACT WERE RELIED ON BY THE COURT IN ZACK. NOW, WHEN WE
SAY -- I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE CASES A LITTLE BIT LATER,
YOUR HONOR, AS WELL, BUT I WOULD INVITE THE COURT -- IT ISN'T THAT
LENGTHY A PORTION OF OUR BRIEF -- TO LOOK AT 27 THROUGH 33 BECAUSE WE
REALLY DID LAY OUT THE CASES. WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACTS AND WE TALKED
ABOUT THE HOLDINGS. I THINK IN LIGHT OF THE COURT'S QUESTIONS AND
COUNSEL'S COMMENTS IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO YOUR HONOR. NOW, WHEN WE SAY
THAT THERE IS A DISTINCT MOTIVE ANALYSIS IN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES,
I WOULD LIKE TO DEFINE WHAT WE MEAN AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF I CAN
FRAME FOR YOUR HONOR THE CONTROVERSY THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE PROSECUTION
AND THE DEFENSE, IN OTHER WORDS, WHERE WE DISAGREE, VERY PRECISELY. WHAT
I MEAN IS THAT WE MEAN THAT YOU DO NOT APPLY DISTINCTIVE MO ANALYSIS.
THAT IS A KEY POINT OF WHAT WE ARE SAYING WHEN WE SAY THAT THERE IS A
RELAXED OR MORE LIBERAL RULE OF ADMISSIBILITY IN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE
CASES. NOW, THE DEFENSE, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS CLEARLY CLAIMING THAT YOU
STILL HAVE TO APPLY DISTINCTIVE MO ANALYSIS EVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF
RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES, THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO APPLY IT, IF I'M
UNDERSTANDING WHAT MR. UELMEN SAID. I BELIEVE THAT THAT SHARPLY DEFINES
THE KEY LEGAL DISAGREEMENT THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE DEFENSE AND THE
PROSECUTION. THEY SAY YOU HAVE TO APPLY MO, DISTINCTIVE MO. WE SAY THAT
YOU DON'T. NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW THE COURT'S ATTENTION TO WHAT
PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK SAYS ON THIS QUESTION, BECAUSE WHAT THEY DO, AND
AGAIN I KNOW YOUR HONOR HAS READ THIS CASE, BUT I JUST POINT OUT THAT
WHAT ZACK DID IS HE ACTUALLY DISCUSSED THE CALIFORNIA CASE LAW LEADING
UP TO ZACK AND THEY DID IT IN A FAIRLY SCHOLARLY AND VERY NICE FASHION
IN TERMS OF LAYING OUT WHY THIS IS THE LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,
AND AFTER DOING THAT THEY SAID:

"AFTER REVIEWING THE LEADING CASES IN THIS AREA" AND THAT INCLUDED
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASES WHICH ARE STILL VALID PRECEDENT "FROM
THESE PRECEDENTS, AS WELL AS COMMON SENSE, EXPERIENCE AND LOGIC, WE
DISTILL THE FOLLOWING RULE: WHERE A DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH A VIOLENT
CRIME AND HAS OR HAD A PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM, PRIOR
ASSAULTS UPON THE SAME VICTIM, WHEN OFFERED ON A DISPUTED ISSUE, E.G.,
INTENT, IDENTITY, MOTIVE, ET CETERA, ARE ADMISSIBLE BASED SOLELY UPON
THE CONSIDERATION OF IDENTICAL PERPETRATOR AND VICTIM WITHOUT RESORT TO
A DISTINCTIVE MODUS OPERANDI ANALYSIS OF OTHER FACTORS." SO THAT IS
PRECISELY WHAT WE ARE SAYING HERE AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE
RELIED HEAVILY ON ZACK, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY STATED IT SO CLEARLY AND SO
NICELY, BUT THERE ARE OTHER CASES THAT STATE IT AS WELL, BUT WE SIMPLY
LIKE THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY USED HERE. NOW, COUNSEL, IN THEIR MOVING
PAPERS, TREATED THIS IN A FOOTNOTE AND WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT ZACK IS THEY
INTERPRETED IT IN THEIR MOVING PAPERS THE SAME EXACT WAY WE DID. WE
SAID, LOOK, WE KNOW THERE IS THIS CASE. WE KNOW THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS. WE
KNOW IT SAYS YOU DON'T APPLY MO ANALYSIS. YOUR HONOR, IT IS WRONG. DON'T
FOLLOW IT. IT IS BAD LAW. NOW, I HAVE TO COMPLIMENT THEM ON TAKING WHAT
IS A VERY GUTSY APPROACH, BECAUSE THAT IS AN ARGUMENT THAT ATTORNEYS
DON'T LIKE TO MAKE, THAT THERE IS A CASE THAT IS SQUARELY -- SQUARELY
ADDRESSES AN ISSUE AND SAY, YOUR HONOR, PLEASE IGNORE IT, IT IS BAD LAW,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CAN'T COME UP WITH ANY REAL ARGUMENTS TO ADVANCE
THAT POSITION AND THERE IS NO CONFLICT IN THE CASE AUTHORITY, THERE IS
NO SPLIT IN THE AUTHORITY. SO WHAT THEY DID IS THEY APPEARED TO MODIFY
THE APPROACH THAT THEY TOOK IN THEIR RESPONSIVE PLEADING AND THE
APPROACH THAT THEY TOOK YESTERDAY, BECAUSE NOW THEY APPEAR TO BE TRYING
TO DISTINGUISH ZACK AND THEY DID IT ON TWO GROUNDS: NO. 1, MR. UELMEN
SAID, WELL, THE MURDER IN ZACK WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR INSTANCES
THAT WERE ADMITTED IN THAT CASE BECAUSE THE VICTIM WAS BEATEN TO DEATH,
AND WHAT THE ZACK COURT WAS REALLY SAYING IS BECAUSE OF THE SIMILARITY
OF THESE INSTANCES THEY WERE ADMISSIBLE. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM
THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIKE AGAIN TO QUOTE FROM ZACK. I WOULD LIKE
BRIEFLY JUST TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FACTS OF THE CASE BECAUSE WHAT
HAPPENED IS HE ABSOLUTELY BRUTALLY KILLED THIS WOMAN IN ZACK AND IN MANY
WAYS THE HOMICIDE OF THE WOMAN IN ZACK WAS FAR MORE GRUESOME AND
HORRIFIC THAN WHAT HAPPENED TO NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. I WOULDN'T SAY THE
SAME THING WITH RESPECT TO THE MURDER OF RON GOLDMAN. AND THE PRIOR
INSTANCES INVOLVED BLACK EYES, AND I KNOW THAT IF MR. UELMEN HAD BEEN
REPRESENTING THE DEFENDANT IN THAT CASE HE WOULD SAY, MY HEAVENS, WHAT
ON EARTH DO BLACK EYES HAVE TO DO WITH THIS KIND OF A BRUTAL HORRIFIC
MURDER. AND HERE IS WHAT ZACK SAYS ON THAT:

"COMMON SENSE, EXPERIENCE AND LOGIC COMPEL THE CONCLUSION THAT THE
DISTINCT DIFFERENT MODUS OPERANDI SIGNATURE CALLING CARD ANALYSIS IN THE
CASES RELIED UPON BY THE APPELLANT IS INAPPLICABLE IN THE PRESENT
CONTEXT. HERE, GIVEN THE BRUTAL AND UNIQUE NATURE OF THE MURDER,
APPELLANT'S PRIOR ASSAULTS UPON THE DECEDENT OF NECESSITY COULD NOT
SURVIVE A DISTINCTIVE MODUS OPERANDI ANALYSIS. ONE COULD NOT KILL THE
SAME PERSON TWICE, YET APPELLATE EXPRESSLY CONTENDS THAT HE HAD NOT
PREVIOUSLY BROKEN THE DECEDENT'S TWO ANKLES NOR HAD HE PREVIOUSLY
INFLICTED 21 WOUNDS TO HER BODY, NOR HAD HE PREVIOUSLY BLUDGEONED HER
ABOUT THE HEAD," AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT OF THESE GROSS DISPARITIES
BETWEEN THE PRIOR CRIMES AND THE CHARGED CRIME THAT THE ZACK COURT
CLEARLY RECOGNIZED, THEN SAID, "IT STILL COMES IN BECAUSE WE ARE NOT
GOING TO APPLY DISTINCTIVE MO ANALYSIS." NOW, COUNSEL ALSO USES A SECOND
WAY OF DISTINGUISHING ZACK, AND I WANT TO DISCUSS THAT AS WELL. THAT IS
THE CONCERN THAT YOUR HONOR ADDRESSED, DOES ZACK DEAL WITH IMPEACHMENT?
AND I HAVE READ THIS CASE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF
FIVE OR SIX YEARS.

*THE COURT:* I HAVE READ IT FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN THE LAST TWO DAYS.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* GOOD. THEN I THINK YOU BEAT ME. AND I REREAD IT AGAIN OF
COURSE WHEN COUNSEL SAID, WELL, THIS IS AN IMPEACHMENT CASE BECAUSE OVER
THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE IT NEVER
EVEN REMOTELY OCCURRED TO ME, AND IT SEEMS THAT THAT ENTIRE ARGUMENT IS
PREMISED ON ONE SENTENCE IN SACK AND THAT ONE SENTENCE IS THE ONE THAT I
ALREADY QUOTED TO THE COURT WHERE THEY SAY THAT, AND I'M PARAPHRASING,
IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE CHARACTERIZING A RELATIONSHIP, THE JURY IS
GOING TO BE MISLED INTO BELIEVING THAT THE PARTING OF THE DEFENDANT AND
THE VICTIM WERE ON AMICABLE BASIS, AND IT IS GOING TO BE MISLED INTO
BELIEVING THAT THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS IN THE RELATIONSHIP. I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT SINGLE INCIDENCE AND, THAT IS THE ONLY SENTENCE IN ZACK THAT
EVEN ARGUABLY SUPPORTS THE DEFENSE POSITION, CAN BE READ AS CONSTITUTING
AN IMPEACHMENT ISSUE. THEY DIDN'T MENTION, AS YOUR HONOR SAID, ANYWHERE
THAT THE DEFENDANT TESTIFIED. WHAT THEY MENTIONED IS THAT THE
DEFENDANT'S EXTRAJUDICIAL STATEMENTS WERE PUT IN EVIDENCE AND THE
STATEMENT THAT HE GAVE WAS THAT HE WAS IN CARMEL FISHING AT THE TIME OF
THE MURDER, AND THE PROSECUTION PUT IN EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT THERE
WAS A VERY SERIOUS WINTER STORM AT THE TIME; THEREFORE IT WAS HIGHLY
IMPLAUSIBLE. THE ONLY THING THAT HE SAID ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP IS HE
DID IN FACT ADMIT THAT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY THREATENED HIS WIFE. THERE WAS
NOTHING IN THAT EXTRAJUDICIAL STATEMENT WHICH WAS -- WHICH WAS WRITTEN
ABOUT BY THE COURT IN A STEP-BY-STEP POINT-BY-POINT MANNER THAT SAID
ANYTHING TO THE EFFECT THAT HE GOT ALONG WITH HIS WIFE. IN FACT, QUITE
THE CONTRARY, BECAUSE AS I SAID, DID HE ADMIT THE THREATS. IF THIS HAD
BEEN AN IMPEACHMENT CASE, YOUR HONOR, THEN WE WOULD HAVE SEEN CASE LAW
RELATING TO IMPEACHMENT. WE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE THROUGH AN 1101 ANALYSIS,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE THROUGH A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE ANALYSIS. WE
WOULD HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE CODE SECTIONS IN THE 700 SERIES CITED THAT DEAL
WITH IMPEACHMENT. THIS IS STRICTLY, WHEN YOU READ IT, A 1101(B)
RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE THAT DISCUSSES -- DISCUSSES THE ADMISSIBILITY
OF THIS EVIDENCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING AN ELEMENT OF THE
PROSECUTION'S CASE, AND IN THIS CASE IT WAS IDENTITY. SO I DO SEE ZACK
AS BEING ON ALL FOURS WITH THE CASE AND THAT VIEWPOINT IS STRENGTHENED
BY THE FACT THAT THE CASES RELIED ON IN ZACK ALSO WERE
1101(B)/RELATIONSHIP SILENCE CASES THAT SAID THAT THIS WAS ADMISSIBLE IN
THE PROSECUTION'S CASE IN CHIEF FOR PROVING IDENTITY, FOR PROVING INTENT
OR PROVING ABSENCE OF ACCIDENT OR MISTAKE. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF
THEORIES THAT THE CASE LAW HAS PREVIOUSLY ALLOWED THIS ON. NOW, I WOULD
SUBMIT TO YOUR HONOR THAT THERE IS NO CALIFORNIA AUTHORITY THAT IS
INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW THAT I HAVE ARTICULATED SO FAR THIS
MORNING; THAT IS, THAT THERE IS A DISTINCT WAY, A DISTINCT BODY OF CASE
LAW FOR ANALYZING THESE KIND OF CASES AND THAT WE DON'T APPLY
DISTINCTIVE MO ANALYSIS. THE CASE THAT COUNSEL RELIED ON IN THEIR PAPERS
VERY HEAVILY WAS PEOPLE VERSUS HASTON AND THAT IS THE SEMINAL CASE WHICH
USES THE LANGUAGE OF PRIOR MO AND TALKS ABOUT SIGNATURE CRIMES AND THE
LIKE. I WOULD LIKE TO ILLUSTRATE, HOWEVER, WHY EVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF A
ROBBERY CASE, WHERE WE THINK THAT THE DISTINCTIVE MO ANALYSIS WOULD
ALWAYS APPLY, IT DOESN'T EVEN ALWAYS NECESSARILY APPLY THERE, BECAUSE
THE ISSUE IS ONE OF LOGICAL RELEVANCE. AND I WOULD ASK YOUR HONOR TO
IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE I WAS TRYING, FOR EXAMPLE, A DEFENDANT FOR A
ROBBERY OR A SERIES OF ROBBERIES INVOLVING DEPARTMENT STORES AND IT
TURNED OUT THAT IN THIS SERIES OF ROBBERIES THE DEFENDANT HAD COMMITTED
THE ROBBERIES WITH A CO-CONSPIRATOR, WITH AN UNCHARGED CO-CONSPIRATOR IN
ALL THREE EVENTS. AND I SAID, YOUR HONOR, I WANT TO PUT ON EVIDENCE OF
THREE OTHER ROBBERIES THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO, THEY WERE OF
RESTAURANTS, AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE THEM FOR THE PURPOSES OF SHOWING
IDENTITY. AND YOU SAID TO ME, OKAY, WELL, MR. GOLDBERG, WHAT IS THE
DISTINCTIVE MO? WHAT IS THE DISTINCTIVE SIGNATURE OF THE PRIOR
ROBBERIES? THERE ARE DISTINCTIONS. I MEAN, THE CHARGED CRIMES INVOLVED
DEPARTMENT STORES; THE UNCHARGED CRIMES INVOLVED RESTAURANTS. THERE ARE
ALL KINDS OF OTHER DISTINCTIONS. AND I SAID, YOUR HONOR, THERE AREN'T
ANY. THERE AREN'T ANY DISTINCTIONS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY UNIQUE, EXCEPT
ONE, AND THAT IS THAT IN ALL OF THE PRIOR ROBBERIES THE DEFENDANT
COMMITTED THEM WITH THE SAME CO-CONSPIRATOR, UNCHARGED CO-CONSPIRATOR,
AS IN THIS CASE, AND ALL I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO SHOW THAT THESE TWO
PEOPLE ARE RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER, BECAUSE IF MY WITNESSES COME INTO
COURT AND THEY IDENTIFY THE DEFENDANT CORRECTLY AND THEN IDENTIFY THE
UNCHARGED CO-CONSPIRATOR CORRECTLY, THAT LENDS PERSUASIVE SUPPORT TO THE
IDEA THAT THE DEFENDANT AND NOT SOME OTHER PERSON WAS THE ASSAILANT IN
THE CHARGED CRIME, BECAUSE I HAVE SHOWN THIS RELATIONSHIP, SO THAT IS
ALL I WANT TO SHOWN IS THE RELATIONSHIP. WELL, I THINK THAT YOUR HONOR
WOULD ALLOW THE EVIDENCE IN, AND I BELIEVE THAT THE REASON THAT THE
COURT WOULD ALLOW THE EVIDENCE IN, ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT IT MAKES
LOGICAL SENSE, IS THAT THE FACTS THAT I JUST RELATED TO YOUR HONOR ARE
PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED IN PEOPLE VERSUS HASTON, THE VERY CASE THAT THE
DEFENDANT RELIED ON WHERE THE COURT SAID THAT SHOWING THAT RELATIONSHIP,
EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NOTHING PARTICULARLY DISTINCTIVE ABOUT THE CHARGE
AND UNCHARGED CRIMES IN AND OF ITSELF, WAS RELEVANT FOR THE PURPOSES OF
SHOWING IDENTITY. NOW, THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE HASTON WAS EXTENDED
IN PEOPLE VERSUS BEAMON. IT IS NOT THE BEAMON CASE THAT YOUR HONOR MIGHT
BE THINKING OF DEALING WITH THE STANDARD FOR ACCOMPLICES. IT IS AN
EARLIER CASE THAT WE CITED IN OUR POINTS AND AUTHORITIES, AND HERE IS
WHAT THEY SAY THERE:

"THE COMMON MARK OF IDENTICAL PERPETRATOR AND IDENTICAL VICTIM IN BOTH
THE CHARGED AND UNCHARGED OFFENSES IS SO DISTINCTIVE THAT IT ADDS
PERSUASIVE SUPPORT TO THE INFERENCE THAT THE DEFENDANT AND NOT SOME
OTHER PERSON WAS THE PERPETRATOR." THAT WAS AT PAGE 633. NOW, WHAT THEY
ARE SAYING, THEREFORE, IS THAT NOW NOT ONLY CAN I GET IN A PRIOR CRIME
IF THEY INVOLVE THE TWO IDENTICAL ASSAILANTS, BUT I CAN GET IN ANY PRIOR
CRIME THAT INVOLVES IDENTICAL VICTIM AND IDENTICAL PERPETRATOR BASED
SOLELY UPON THAT SINGLE SIMILARITY, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANALYZING ANY
OTHER ACTS OF SIMILARITY. WHAT THE POINT IS THAT I'M MAKING, YOUR HONOR,
IS THAT THE CASE OF HASTON ITSELF, PARTICULARLY EXTENDED BY BEAMON,
BELIE THE VERY RULE THAT THE DEFENSE IS ASKING YOUR HONOR TO APPLY IN
THIS CASE, THAT IS, THE DISTINCTIVE MODUS OPERANDI RULE ALWAYS APPLIES,
BECAUSE HERE ARE TWO CASES THAT IT DIDN'T APPLY, EVEN THOUGH THEY DEALT
WITH RELATIVELY TRADITIONALLY 1101(B) SCENARIOS WHERE TYPICALLY YOU
WOULD APPLY THE RULE. THEY ARE TYPICALLY SIGNATURE FOR ANOTHER REASON
AND THAT IS THAT THEY WERE RELIED ON BY THE COURT IN ZACK, AND THE WAY
THAT ZACK ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IDENTICAL PERPETRATOR AND
IDENTICAL VICTIM IN AND OF ITSELF WAS SUFFICIENT TO GET THE PRIOR CRIMES
IN, WAS BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT THIS WAS THE LOGICAL INFERENCE TO BE
DRAWN FROM THE HASTON CASE, WHICH COUNSEL RELIED ON, AND FROM THE BEAMON
CASE, WHICH THE PEOPLE RELIED ON. YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE TO NOW TURN
TO THE SECOND PART OF OUR ANALYSIS WHERE I WILL BE DISCUSSING A COMMON
TRADITIONAL 1101(B) TYPE APPROACH.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. GOLDBERG, BEFORE DO YOU THAT, LET ME TAKE A
COURT REPORTER RECESS FOR FIFTEEN.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* OKAY. THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WE WILL STAND IN RECESS FOR FIFTEEN.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. ALL PARTIES ARE
PRESENT. MR. GOLDBERG, YOU WISH TO CONTINUE YOUR COMMENTS?

*MR. GOLDBERG:* YES, THANK YOU. YOUR HONOR, JUST BEFORE WE BROKE, I WAS
ABOUT TO LAUNCH INTO THE SECOND PART OF MY ARGUMENT, WHICH IS THE
TRADITIONAL EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101(B) ANALYSIS. AND AS WE STATED, WE
HAVE THREE SUB PARTS TO THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MODE OF EVIDENCE FOR
THE PURPOSES OF PROVING IDENTITY, THAT'S ONE; MOTIVE EVIDENCE FOR THE
PURPOSES OF PROVING INTENT, THAT'S NUMBER TWO; AND THEN ALSO, COMMON
PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN, WHICH IS NUMBER 3. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST START
BY MENTIONING SOMETHING THAT WAS STATED IN THE DEFENSE RESPONSE BRIEF,
AND THAT WAS A DISAGREEMENT THAT THEY HAD WITH OUR POSITION REGARDING
THE STANDARD OF REVIEW THAT IS INVOLVED BY A TRIAL JUDGE IN LOOKING AT
THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE, BECAUSE WE TOOK THE POSITION THAT THIS WAS A
QUESTION OF DISCRETION THAT INVOLVES AN ISSUE OF EVALUATING THE EVIDENCE
TO DETERMINE ITS RELEVANCY. AND I JUST WANTED TO GIVE ANOTHER CITE ON
THAT BECAUSE I DID REALIZE THAT THERE WAS AN AMBIGUITY IN THE CITE WE
HAD GIVEN PREVIOUSLY. AND THAT IS PEOPLE VERSUS HASTON AT 69 CAL. 2D
246, THE SAME CASE THAT I PREVIOUSLY HAD CITED TO THE COURT AND THAT
COUNSEL RELIED ON VERY HEAVILY IN HIS POINTS AND AUTHORITIES, WHERE THEY
SAID:

"IT IS CLEAR OF COURSE THAT THE ADMISSION OF OTHER CRIMES EVIDENCE TO
PROVE IDENTITY IS ESSENTIALLY A MATTER WITHIN THE SOUND DISCRETION OF
THE TRIAL COURT." SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT INVOLVES AN EXERCISE OF
DISCRETION. THAT IS THE STANDARD OF REVIEW THAT YOUR HONOR IS BEING
ASKED TO USE HERE. NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO JUST START WITH THE LANGUAGE OF
EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101 ITSELF BECAUSE SO FRANKLY WE DON'T GO BACK TO
THE CODE SINCE WE'VE READ IT SO MANY TIMES. BUT IN 1101(B), IT SAYS THAT:

"NOTHING IN THE SECTION PROHIBITS THE ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE THAT A
PERSON COMMITTED A CRIME, CIVIL WRONG OR OTHER ACT WHEN RELEVANT TO
PROVE SOME FACT SUCH AS MOTIVE, OPPORTUNITY, INTENT PREPARATION, PLAN,"
AND SO ON. I WON'T QUOTE THE REST OF THE LANGUAGE. AND THEN IT GOES ON
TO SAY:

"EXCEPT DISPOSITION TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACT." NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT
LANGUAGE -- AND MR. UELMEN SAYS, WELL, THIS IS A RULE OF EXCLUSION OTHER
COMMENTATORS ARGUE NO, IT'S A RULE OF INCLUSION. I THINK THAT'S JUST A
SEMANTICS DEBATE. WHAT IS APPARENT FROM THE LANGUAGE, YOUR HONOR, IS
THAT THIS IS A RELEVANCY TEST. AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY THE STANDARD OF
REVIEW IS ONE OF DISCRETION, BECAUSE WHAT IS BEING ASKED OF THE COURT IS
-- IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE, IS IT RELEVANT TO ANY OF THE
ENUMERATED PROVISIONS, ANY OF THE ENUMERATED IDEAS OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT
IS AT ISSUE IN THE TRIAL, EXCEPT DISPOSITION. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT
THE PROSECUTOR SIMPLY HAS TO SAY, "WE ARE INTRODUCING THIS FOR THE
PURPOSES OF PROVING INTENT, IDENTITY, COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN OR
ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE CAN LEGITIMATELY PROVE, AND THAT AS LONG AS THAT'S
REASONABLE, IN OTHER WORDS, AS LONG AS OUR ARGUMENT IS REASONABLE AND
ONE THAT A REASONABLE JURY COULD ACCEPT, THAT UNDER 1101(B), THE
EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE." THAT IS WHY I CHARACTERIZE 1101(B) AS BEING A
MERE RELEVANCY TEST. NOW, AS SUPPORT FOR THAT PROVISION, OTHER THAN THE
STATUTORY LANGUAGE, I ALSO WOULD CITE THE CASE THAT WAS EXTENSIVELY
RELIED ON, ONE OF THE TWO CASES EXTENSIVELY RELIED ON BY THE DEFENSE
YESTERDAY. THAT WAS PEOPLE VERSUS THOMAS, 20 CAL. 3D. 457 AT 465. THAT
WAS A CHILD MOLESTATION CASE WHERE THE DEFENDANT MOLESTED A DAUGHTER,
AND 10 YEARS EARLIER, HE HAD MOLESTED ANOTHER DAUGHTER. AND THE WAY THAT
THE CASE WAS BEING CITED, YOU WOULD THINK THAT THIS WAS A VERY DAMAGING
CASE TO THE PROSECUTION ON THE ISSUE OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE.
BUT IN REALITY, WHAT THEY DID IS THAT THEY SET FORWARD A STANDARD
EXPLAINING 1101(B) ANALYSIS THAT REALLY CLARIFIES THAT IT IS AN ISSUE OF
RELEVANCY, A RELEVANCY TEST. AND WHAT THEY SAID IS THAT THE STANDARD IS,
QUOTE:

"WHETHER THERE IS SOME CLEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PRIOR OFFENSE AND
THE ONE CHARGED SO THAT IT MAY BE LOGICALLY INFERRED THAT IF THE
DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OF ONE, HE MUST BE GUILTY OF THE OTHER OR, AS THE
MATTER IS SOMETIMES STATED, THE OTHER OFFENSES ARE SUFFICIENTLY SIMILAR
AND POSSESS A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH DEGREE OF COMMON FEATURES OF THE ACT
CHARGED, THAT THEY WARRANT THE INFERENCE THAT IF THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED
THE OTHER ACTS, HE COMMITTED THE ACT CHARGED," END QUOTE. NOW, IT'S A
LITTLE BIT CONVOLUTED PERHAPS, BUT ALL THEY ARE SAYING HERE IS, THEY ARE
SAYING THAT IF THE PRIOR CRIME WARRANTS THE INFERENCE THAT IF THE
DEFENDANT COMMITTED THE PRIOR ONE, HE ALSO COMMITTED THE CHARGED CRIME,
THAT IT MEETS THE TEST OF 1101. THAT SOUNDS LIKE MERE RELEVANCY. THAT
SOUNDS LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS, WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH IT'S RELEVANT TO
PROVE THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE CAN USE IT TO
PROVE CERTAIN OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME IN THIS CASE.

*THE COURT:* ARE YOU SUGGESTING I IGNORE THE SIMILARITY LANGUAGE IN THAT
PASSAGE?

*MR. GOLDBERG:* THE ISSUE OF SIMILARITY IS ONE THAT GOES TO RELEVANCE,
LOGICAL RELEVANCE. AND NORMALLY SPEAKING, THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE
SOME SIMILARITY FOR THEM TO BE LOGICALLY RELEVANT. IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE
VERSUS HASTON, THE ONLY SIMILARITY WAS IDENTICAL PERPETRATORS IN THE
CHARGED AND UNCHARGED OFFENSE. AND PEOPLE VERSUS BEAMON, IT WAS
IDENTICAL DEFENDANT AND IDENTICAL VICTIM. ZACK SAYS THE SIMILARITY OF
IDENTICAL VICTIM AND IDENTICAL DEFENDANT IN AND OF ITSELF IS SUFFICIENT.
SO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO APPROACH IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LOGICAL
RELEVANCE AND ASK OURSELVES, WHAT IS IT THAT THE PROSECUTION IS TRYING
TO PROVE HERE AND DOES THIS LOGICALLY PROVE THAT. AND NORMALLY SPEAKING,
IF YOU APPLY THAT ANALYSIS, IN OTHER WORDS, A COMMON SENSE LOGICAL
RELEVANCE ANALYSIS, THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE AT LEAST SOME
SIMILARITY. I THINK IF WE WANTED TO SHOW THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD
PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED THE OFFENSE OF DRUNK DRIVING, HOW ON EARTH WOULD
THAT MAKE IT LIKELY THAT HE COMMITTED THIS MURDER? IT HAS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT WHATSOEVER FROM A LOGICAL, RELEVANCE STANDPOINT.
BUT CLEARLY A SERIES OF OFFENSES COMMITTED AGAINST THE SAME VICTIM DO IN
THIS CASE JUST AS THEY DO IN ZACK AND ZACK'S PROGENY. WHAT HAPPENED IN
THOMAS BY THE WAY WAS THAT THE COURT DECIDED THAT ALTHOUGH THE PRIOR
CRIME WAS TECHNICALLY RELEVANT UNDER 1101(B), BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS A
10-YEAR GAP, THE 10-YEAR GAP MADE IT SUCH THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
ADMITTED UNDER 352 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE. AND I WOULD ASK THE COURT TO
JUST KEEP IN MIND FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THE FACTS OF THOMAS BECAUSE IT
BECOMES RELEVANT WHEN WE DISCUSS PEOPLE VERSUS EWOLDT, WHICH DEALS WITH
THE VERY, VERY SIMILAR FACT PATTERN AND WHICH IT WAS ANOTHER CASE THAT
THE DEFENSE RELIES HEAVILY ON. AS WE SAID, PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK IS NOT THE
ONLY RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE WHICH SUPPORTS THE PROSECUTION'S
POSITION. I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE PROSECUTION'S BRIEF AND GO
THROUGH EACH OF THE OTHER CASES THAT WE FEEL ARE RELEVANT. I WOULD LIKE
TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE CASES WHERE IDENTITY WAS THE ISSUE IN
RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES AND DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE CASES
AND WHY IT IS THAT THEY VERY CLEARLY SUPPORT THE ANALYSIS THE
PROSECUTION IS PROFFERING HERE, WHICH IS THAT MOTIVE EVIDENCE IS
RELEVANT TO PROVE IDENTITY AND RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS ARE RELEVANT TO
PROVE MOTIVE. THE EARLIEST CASE IS PEOPLE VERSUS ARGENTOS. IT'S A 1909
CASE. THIS DEMONSTRATES, AS MR. GORDON POINTED OUT, THAT WE HAVE ALMOST
A HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY, MAYBE EVEN EARLIER BECAUSE I COULD HAVE -- WE
COULD HAVE TRIED TO TRACE IT BACK EARLIER. WE DIDN'T. WE FELT THAT THAT
WAS FAR ENOUGH. THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY BEFORE THE ENACTMENT OF THE EVIDENCE
CODE. BUT THEY ARE APPLYING THE COMMON LAW PROVISIONS AS MR. UELMEN
POINTED OUT. THE 1101(B) TYPE ANALYSIS WAS PART OF THE COMMON LAW AND
HAS BEEN FOR MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS. PEOPLE VERSUS ARGENTOS DEALT WITH
THE SITUATION WHERE THERE WERE TWO GOLD PROSPECTORS AND ONE OF THE GOLD
PROSPECTORS KILLED HIS BUSINESS PARTNER. SO IT IS A RELATIONSHIP CASE
ONLY. IT'S DEALING WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS. EVIDENCE WAS INTRODUCED THAT
THE DEFENDANT IN THAT CASE HAD BEEN ARRESTED FOR A CRIME. THE SUPREME
COURT DID NOT TELL US WHAT THE CRIME WAS IN THEIR RECITATION OF FACTS.
HE -- THE BUSINESS PARTNER, THE VICTIM ARRANGED FOR A BOND FORUM ON THAT
CRIME AND DEMANDED REPAYMENT. SO IT'S SIGNIFICANT FROM A COUPLE
PERSPECTIVES. NUMBER ONE, IT SHOWS ECONOMIC FRICTION AS BEING THE BASIS
FOR MOTIVE EVIDENCE IN A RELATIONSHIP CONTEXT AS MS. BODIN SAID. BUT
MORE IMPORTANTLY, HERE IS WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SAID WHERE
THE ISSUE IS IDENTITY. THEY SAID:

"PROOF OF SOME OTHER CRIME MAY BE GIVEN WHERE IT TENDS TO SHOW MOTIVE
FOR THE HOMICIDE IN QUESTION. IN CASES WHERE THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON
WHO COMMITS A CRIME IS ATTEMPTED TO BE PROVEN BY CIRCUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE, EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE ON THE PART OF THE DEFENDANT CHARGED IS
ALWAYS A SUBJECT OF PROOF AND THE FACT OF MOTIVE PARTICULARLY MATERIAL."
SO AGAIN, THIS IS PRECISELY THE RULE THAT WE ARE ASKING THE COURT TO
APPLY THAT WE CAN TRACE ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1909. WE WANT TO PROVE
FRICTION. WE WANT TO PROVE PROBLEMS IN THE RELATIONSHIP. WE WANT TO
PROVE A PATTERN OF ABUSIVE CONTROL BECAUSE THAT PROVES MOTIVE WHICH, IN
THE SUPREME COURT'S WORDS, IS ALWAYS RELEVANT FOR THE PURPOSES OF
ESTABLISHING IDENTITY. NOW, THE NEXT IDENTITY CASE THAT WE HAVE IN THE
CONTEXT OF RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE IS PEOPLE VERSUS MULLEN. THAT WAS A
1953 CASE AND DECIDED IN 1953. AND IN THAT CASE, THE DEFENDANT WAS
ROMANTICALLY INTERESTED IN A FELLOW PRISONER. HE WAS INCARCERATED AT THE
TIME. AND THE VICTIM IN THAT CASE HE PERCEIVED TO BE INTERFERING WITH
THAT RELATIONSHIP. SO THIS IS A JEALOUSY CASE AND AN OBSESSION TYPE
CASE, AS MS. BODIN ARGUED. AND THERE THE ISSUE WAS IDENTITY, WHO
COMMITTED THE CRIME. AND THE COURT SAID:

"ANTAGONISM OR ENMITY BETWEEN A DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM OF AN ASSAULT
IS ADMITTEDLY RELEVANT TO THE ISSUE OF DEFENDANT'S IDENTITY AS THE
ASSAILANT." SO THIS IS TELLING US THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF RELATIONSHIPS,
WHERE THERE'S RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM, THE
EVIDENCE OF ANTAGONISM, ENMITY IS RELEVANT, IS ADMISSIBLE TO PROVE
IDENTITY. NEXT WE HAVE PEOPLE VERSUS HELFEND, WHICH WAS A CASE WHERE THE
DEFENDANT MURDERED HIS FORMER WIFE'S HUSBAND BECAUSE OF JEALOUSY WITH
RESPECT TO THE WIFE APPARENTLY. AND FOUR YEARS EARLIER, THERE WERE
CERTAIN ACTS OF PROPERTY DESTRUCTION. SPECIFICALLY HE HAD BURNED DOWN
THE VICTIM'S HOUSE. SO AGAIN, TALKING ABOUT PROPERTY DESTRUCTION. THERE
WERE ALSO OTHER TYPES OF EVIDENCE SHOWING ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE
DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM AND THE JEALOUSY THAT EXISTED IN THAT
RELATIONSHIP, AND THE COURT AGAIN HELD THAT THE EVIDENCE CAME IN. AND
THEN FINALLY, PEOPLE VERSUS DANIELS WHICH WAS CITED PROMINENTLY BY THE
ZACK COURT WHERE THE DEFENDANT TRIED TO -- IT WAS AN ATTEMPTED MURDER
CASE ACTUALLY WHERE THE DEFENDANT TRIED TO KILL HIS SPOUSE WITH A BOMB
BY BLOWING HER UP. AND THERE THEY WANTED TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE OF PRIOR
QUARRELING AND PRIOR PROBLEMS IN THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH INCLUDED
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. AND THE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AMOUNTED TO SIMPLE
ASSAULTS. AND I'M SURE THAT IF MR. UELMEN WERE ARGUING THAT, HE WOULD
SAY, "MY HEAVENS, WHAT ON EARTH DOES A SIMPLE ASSAULT HAVE TO DO WITH
BLOWING SOMEONE UP? I MEAN THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO SIMILARITY AT ALL
THERE." BUT THE COURT SAID, QUOTE:

"IT IS ELEMENTARY, EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE TO COMMIT AN OFFENSE IS EVIDENCE
OF THE IDENTITY OF THE OFFENDER.

"EVIDENCE SHOWING JEALOUSY, QUARRELS, ANTAGONISM OR ENMITY BETWEEN THE
ACCUSED AND THE VICTIM OF A VIOLENT OFFENSE IS PROOF OF MOTIVE TO COMMIT
THE OFFENSE," END QUOTE. SO WE HAVE MANY CASES WHICH HOLD THAT WE CAN
INTRODUCE EVIDENCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF SHOWING IDENTITY, INCLUDING OF
COURSE PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK EVEN UNDER A TRADITIONAL 1101(B) ANALYSIS. AND
THESE CASES DO NOT INVOLVE SITUATIONS WHERE THE OTHER KINDS OF ACTS OF
ABUSE NECESSARILY INVOLVE SIMILARITIES WITH THE CHARGED ACT AT ALL OTHER
THAN THEY WERE DIRECTED AGAINST THE SAME VICTIM. NOW, THE SECOND 1101(B)
THEORY THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS PRESENTED IS THAT THIS EVIDENCE IS
ADMISSIBLE FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVING MOTIVE WHICH IN TURN PROVES
INTENT. AND COUNSEL SEEMED TO ARGUE THAT THE PROSECUTION IS ONLY ALLOWED
TO USE THIS THEORY, IF I WAS UNDERSTANDING HIS ARGUMENT YESTERDAY, IF WE
-- THEY HAVE CONCEDED THAT THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED THE CRIME AND THE
ONLY ISSUE IS INTENT. THAT IS NOT TRUE. THE PROSECUTION BEARS THE BURDEN
OF PROVING EVERY ELEMENT OF OUR OFFENSE. THERE ARE TWO CASES THAT
CLARIFY THAT THAT IS IN FACT THE RULE. ONE IS PEOPLE VERSUS DANIELS,
THAT'S 52 CAL. 3D. 815, WHERE THE SUPREME COURT SAID THAT THE
DEFENDANT'S PLEA OF NOT GUILTY PUTS IN TO ISSUE ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF
THE OFFENSE AND THAT THE PROSECUTION IS ALLOWED TO INTRODUCE UNCHARGED
MISCONDUCT FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVING INTENT EVEN THOUGH THE DEFENSE
HASN'T SPECIFICALLY IN SOME WAY STATED THAT THAT IS THE ONLY ISSUE
INVOLVED IN THE CASE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROVE EVERY ELEMENT OF THE
OFFENSE. THE SAME EXACT OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT IN ESTELLE VERSUS MC GUIRE, WHICH I'LL ADDRESS IN A
CONTEXT OF A DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT THAT THE DEFENSE MADE. THE CASE THAT
WE BELIEVE IS MOST INSTRUCTIVE ON THE INTENT ISSUE -- BECAUSE WHAT YOUR
HONOR MAY BE WONDERING IS, WELL, WE HAVE THESE AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS, WE
HAVE THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS. THEY VERY CLEARLY PORTRAY THAT THERE
WAS A FIXED PURPOSE, FULL INTENT TO KILL, WHERE THE DEFENDANT LITERALLY
WENT FOR THE JUGULAR IN THIS CASE. WHY DO WE NEED FURTHER EVIDENCE OF
INTENT? AND WHAT I WOULD POINT OUT TO YOUR HONOR IS THE LAW THAT WE
APPLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO PREMEDITATION BECAUSE
THAT'S PRIMARILY WHERE THIS BECOMES AN ISSUE. AS YOUR HONOR KNOWS, FOR
THE PURPOSES OF 1118 MOTION, FOR THE PURPOSES OF APPEAL, FOR THE
PURPOSES OF A NEW TRIAL MOTION, ALTHOUGH THE JURY ISN'T INSTRUCTED ON
THIS, THERE IS A THREE-PART TEST THAT WE USE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE
PURPOSES OF PREMEDITATION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE SUPREME COURT IN
ANDERSON. THAT THREE-PART TEST IS THAT WE HAVE TO SHOW PLANNING
ACTIVITY. WE HAVE TO SHOW MOTIVE. THAT'S THE SECOND. AND THEN THIRD, WE
HAVE TO SHOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE MANNER OF THE KILLING AS INFERRED FROM
THE CRIME ITSELF. NOW, THIS TEST WAS APPLIED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME
COURT AGAIN IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS NICHOLAS, WHICH IS INSTRUCTIVE
BECAUSE THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE, NICHOLAS. AND IN THAT, THE
DEFENDANT KILLED HIS EX-WIFE AND THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A BITTER AND
LONG-STANDING GRUDGE THAT EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO. IT INCLUDED WHAT
COULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS STALKING EVIDENCE. IN ONE OF THE INSTANCES,
THE VICTIM WAS AT A LAUNDROMAT, AND THE DEFENDANT SHOWED UP
UNEXPECTEDLY, SIMILAR TO MANY OF THE INSTANCES IN OUR CASE, AND JUST
STARED AT HER THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE LAUNDROMAT. CALIFORNIA SUPREME
COURT -- BY THE WAY, THIS IS A 1991 CASE -- SAID THAT ALL OF THIS
EVIDENCE WAS NOT ONLY ADMISSIBLE, BUT NECESSARY. AND HERE'S WHAT THEY
SAID IN APPLYING THEIR ANALYSIS. THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW UNDER ANDERSON WE
HAVE TO PROVE THESE THREE ELEMENTS. AND HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT THE
SECOND ELEMENT. THIS IS THE MOTIVE ELEMENT, YOUR HONOR. THEY SAID THAT
THE PROSECUTION HAD TO PROVE -- THIS IS HAD TO PROVE," QUOTE:

"HIS MOTIVE TO KILL AS GLEANED FROM HIS PRIOR RELATIONSHIP OR CONDUCT
WITH THE VICTIM," END QUOTE. SO THAT'S NOT SAYING ANY LONGER THAT THIS
IS SOMETHING THAT THE PROSECUTION IS ENTITLED TO PROVE OR IS ALLOWED TO
PROVE OR IS HELPFUL IF WE CAN PROVE THIS. THEY'RE SAYING WE HAVE TO
PROVE THIS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO, FOR THE PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING
ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THIS THREE-PRONG TEST, PUT IN EVIDENCE OF THE
RELATIONSHIP OR CONDUCT WITH THE VICTIM IN ORDER TO GLEAN MOTIVE. THAT
IS A RECENT PRONOUNCEMENT BY OUR CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT, WHICH MAKES
THIS EVIDENCE NOT ONLY ADMISSIBLE, BUT MANDATORY. AND TO EXCLUDE THIS
EVIDENCE, YOUR HONOR, WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY TO CONVERT EVIDENCE CODE
SECTION 1101(B) FROM A SHIELD INTO A SWORD BECAUSE IT WOULD BE -- TO
CONVERT EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101(B) AND THAT FORUM OF ANALYSIS FROM
THE NORMAL ANALYSIS THAT IS DESIGNED TO PRECLUDE IRRELEVANT EVIDENCE
THAT WOULD CAUSE THE JURY TO VOTE GUILTY FOR AN IMPROPER REASON AND INTO
A SWORD WHICH WOULD DEPRIVE AFFIRMATIVELY THE PROSECUTION OF
ESTABLISHING WHAT IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF OUR CASE, SOMETHING THAT WE
HAVE TO PROVE. AND FOR THAT REASON, YOUR HONOR, WE SUGGEST THAT THIS
EVIDENCE CLEARLY IS ADMISSIBLE TO ESTABLISH INTENT. NOW, THAT BRINGS ME
TO THE THIRD PART OF THE 1101(B) ANALYSIS. AND THAT'S PRIOR COMMON PLAN,
SCHEME AND DESIGN. AND I'M GOING TO RELY ON ONE CASE FOR THAT. THAT'S
PEOPLE VERSUS EWOLDT. IT IS THE SAME CASE THAT AGAIN WAS RELIED ON
EXTENSIVELY BY COUNSEL YESTERDAY. AS I SAID, IT'S FACTUALLY SIMILAR TO
THOMAS IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S A CHILD MOLESTATION CASE. I SUPPOSE IN
SOME SENSE, YOU COULD CONSIDER IT TO BE A RELATIONSHIP TYPE OF A CASE
ALTHOUGH IT'S IN A SEXUAL ASSAULT CONTEXT. AND THE PROSECUTION WANTED TO
INTRODUCE EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD 12 YEARS, ACCORDING TO MY
CALCULATIONS, EARLIER MOLESTED ANOTHER DAUGHTER WHO WAS SEPARATED IN AGE
FROM THE CHARGED VICTIM. HE WAS NEVER TRIED FOR THOSE EVENTS. HE WAS
NEVER CONVICTED FOR THE EARLIER CRIME. NOW, THIS CASE IS VERY
INTERESTING AND IT'S VERY CURIOUS THAT COUNSEL NOT ONLY CITED BUT RELIED
ON IT SO PROMINENTLY, BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES THAT'S KEPT IN
THE PROSECUTION'S TREASURE TROVE OF FAVORITE CASES TO PULL OUT WHEN
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 1101(B) ANALYSIS. IT'S PROBABLY A BAD CHOICE
TACTICALLY ON THE PART OF THE DEFENSE TO HAVE RELIED SO HEAVILY ON THIS
CASE BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY, WHEN I FIRST LOOKED AT THE CASE WHEN IT CAME
OUT QUITE RECENTLY, WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS, THEY'VE SIGNIFICANTLY
CHANGED CALIFORNIA LAW ON 1101(B) EVIDENCE AND THEY HAVE CREATED THIS
WHOLE NEW THEORY OF ADMISSIBILITY, THAT BEING COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND
DESIGN IN A WAY THAT DID NOT EXIST PRIOR TO EWOLDT. AND THEY
SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT. AND WHAT THEY SAID IS, THEY SAID EVEN IF
IDENTITY ISN'T AN ISSUE, EVEN IF INTENT ISN'T AN ISSUE, YOU STILL CAN
INTRODUCE EVIDENCE ON COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN BECAUSE IT IS A
THIRD INDEPENDENT THEORY. PRIOR TO EWOLDT, WE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT WE COULD ONLY GET COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN EVIDENCE IF IT WAS
DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO PROVE IDENTITY OR INTENT. SUPREME COURT SAYS NO,
THAT'S WRONG. YOU CAN GET THIS IN AS A THIRD INDEPENDENT THEORY THAT
STANDS ON ITS OWN INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHERS. NOW, COUNSEL SEEMS TO BE
CITING EWOLDT -- IF AGAIN, I'M UNDERSTANDING HIS ARGUMENT -- FOR THE
PROPOSITION THAT WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT ALL OF THE INCIDENTS WERE A PLAN
IN THE SENSE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO SHOW THAT WHEN THE DEFENDANT FIRST
STARTED TO ABUSE NICOLE SIMPSON IN '77, '78, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR FIRST
ACTS, THAT IN HIS MIND, HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF, "WELL, YOU KNOW, GEE, I
THINK I'M GOING TO START ABUSING HER NOW." AND THEN SOMETIME AROUND
1989, "I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A KNOCK-DOWN DRAG-OUT INCIDENT THAT
WILL RESULT IN HER CALLING THE POLICE AND RUNNING OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH
HER CLOTHES TORN OFF." AND THEN AROUND DECEMBER OF '93, "I THINK I'LL
BARGE DOWN -- BREAK DOWN THE DOOR TO HER HOME AND HER BEDROOM DOOR AND
CAUSE HER TO CALL 911." AND THEN AROUND THE MIDDLE OF '94, "I THINK I'LL
KILL HER." THAT IS CLEARLY NOT THE SENSE IN WHICH COMMON PLAN, SCHEME
AND DESIGN IS USED BY THE COURTS, AND WE WERE TOLD THAT VERY CLEARLY IN
EWOLDT BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID. EWOLDT, AS THE COURT IS PROBABLY
AWARE, OVERRULED THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS TASSEL, WHICH WAS A
PROBLEMATIC CASE IN THE AREA OF 1101(B) EVIDENCE. AND WHAT THEY SAID
ABOUT TASSEL WAS, THEY SAID THAT TASSEL WAS BASED UPON, QUOTE:

"THE ERRONEOUS PREMISE THAT A COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN CANNOT BE
ESTABLISHED UNLESS ALL OF THESE ACTS ARE PART OF THE SINGLE CONTINUING
CONCEPTION OR PLOT," END QUOTE. THEY ARE MAKING IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT WE
DO NOT HAVE TO PROVE THAT WHEN THE DEFENDANT STARTED THE ACTS OF ABUSE,
HE HAD CONTEMPLATED THAT THEY WERE ALL GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD
EVENTUALLY LEAD UP TO THE MURDER OF THE VICTIM. RATHER, WHAT THE COURT
SAYS IN EWOLDT -- AND THIS IS AT PAGE 403. THEY SAY THAT RATHER, THE
TERM SIMPLY MEANS THAT, QUOTE:

"RATHER THAN A SERIES OF SIMILAR SPONTANEOUS ACTS," END QUOTE, WE MUST
SHOW A COMMON DESIGN. SO THE ISSUE IS, ARE THESE A SERIES OF SPONTANEOUS
ACTS? IS IT A COINCIDENCE THAT HE JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE COMMITTED THE
INCIDENTS IN 1987, '88 THAT IS TOTALLY UNRELATED TO THE 1989, THAT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 1993, HAS NOTHING TO DO WHATSOEVER WITH THE
MURDER? ARE THEY JUST A SERIES OF SPONTANEOUS DISCONNECTED ACTS OR
RATHER, WERE THEY ALL COMMITTED WITH THE SAME DESIGN IN MIND?

*THE COURT:* HOW DO YOU PLAN ON CONVEYING THAT COMMON SCHEME AND DESIGN
THEORY TO THE JURY?

*MR. GOLDBERG:* WELL, THERE ARE A COUPLE WAYS OF DOING IT. A LOT OF THAT
IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BY MR. GORDON. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IN
OUR --

*THE COURT:* YOU MEAN THERE'S MORE?

*MR. GOLDBERG:* YES. THERE WAS A LITTLE MORE, IF THE COURT WOULD ALLOW.
WE USED THE POWER OF CONTROL WHEEL IN OUR POINTS AND AUTHORITIES, AND
THAT'S GOING TO BE EXPLAINED IN SOME MORE DETAIL, YOUR HONOR. BUT AT THE
HEART OF THE WHEEL IS THE IDEA OF POWER AND CONTROL. THE SPOKES
RADIATING OUT FROM THAT WHEEL DEAL WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
KINDS OF INSTANCES, THE SAME KINDS OF INSTANCES --

*THE COURT:* I THINK -- LET ME BE A LITTLE MORE DIRECT THEN IN MY
QUESTION. IS THIS SORT OF A BACK DOOR WAY THEN TO BRING IN BATTERED
WOMAN'S SYNDROME IN THE TOTALITY OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

*MR. GOLDBERG:* IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE, YOUR HONOR, BECAUSE
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT IF WE TRACE THE CASE LAW AS WE DID AND AS
MS. BODIN DID -- AND WE CAN TRACE IT BACK LONG BEFORE A LOT OF THESE
STUDIES AND THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE EVEN EXISTED -- THEY WERE STILL
ALLOWING IN THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CALLED IT
POWER AND CONTROL PER SE. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE NECESSARILY AS
SOPHISTICATED AND PRECISE AS WE ARE PERHAPS TODAY. THEY TALKED ABOUT
JEALOUSY, QUARREL, ENMITY, ANTAGONISM, THEY TALKED ABOUT ASSAULTS. BUT
THEY SAID THAT THIS COMES IN FOR THE PURPOSES OF SHOWING WHAT THE
RELATIONSHIP IS. AND THAT WAS EVEN BEFORE THEY HAD THIS KIND OF
EMPIRICAL RESEARCH. SO WE CAN USE COMMON SENSE AS WELL AS EMPIRICAL
RESEARCH.

*THE COURT:* BUT HOW DO I DEAL WITH THE PROSCRIPTION, THE EXCLUSION IN
1107?

*MR. GOLDBERG:* AGAIN, AS I SAID, THAT'S AN 1107 ARGUMENT. WHAT I'M
SAYING IS, EVEN WITHOUT 1107, IT STILL COMES IN. WE COULD ARGUE COMMON
SENSE. WE CAN SAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, LOOK AT THE FACTS.
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THIS IS A PATTERN OF ACTIVITIES. THEY ARE
NOT SPONTANEOUS INSTANCES. THEY ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS A PARTICULAR GOAL.
THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR THEME IN MIND THAT RUNS THROUGHOUT THEM. AND THEY
CAN USE THEIR COMMON SENSE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANALYZING IT. I'M NOT
SAYING AN EXPERT WOULDN'T BE HELPFUL AT ALL. I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE.
AND THE ISSUE OF EXPERT TESTIMONY IS AGAIN SOMETHING THAT MR. GORDON
WILL ADDRESS. BUT THE POINT IS THAT EVEN WITHOUT EXPERT TESTIMONY, WHAT
THESE CASES DEMONSTRATE IS THAT WE CAN STILL USE COMMON SENSE FOR THE
PURPOSES OF ALLOWING THIS EVIDENCE IN. AND I SHOULD ADD, YOUR HONOR,
THAT IN THE EWOLDT CASE, I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WAS EXPERT TESTIMONY THAT
WAS INTRODUCED FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOWING THIS COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND
DESIGN EVIDENCE IN.

*THE COURT:* WELL, NO. THE REASON FOR MY CONCERN THOUGH IS THAT 1107
SAYS THAT YOU CAN'T USE THE EXPERT TESTIMONY REGARDING BATTERED WOMAN'S
SYNDROME IN A PARTICULAR SITUATION THAT WE MAY BE BACK-DOORING INTO
HERE. THAT'S MY CONCERN, IS WHERE YOUR ARGUMENT IS GOING.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* I AM SORRY. IS YOUR HONOR -- IF I'M UNDERSTANDING WHAT
THE COURT IS SAYING, THAT IF WE CAN'T CALL THE EXPERT, WE CAN'T EVEN
MAKE THE ARGUMENT WITHOUT THE EXPERT?

*THE COURT:* NO. I'M JUST ASKING YOU, HOW CAN YOU MAKE THE ARGUMENT
WITHOUT HAVING AN EXPERT FOUNDATION FOR THIS IS WHAT IT IS?

*MR. GOLDBERG:* BECAUSE I THINK YOU CAN ARGUE --

*THE COURT:* IT'S A PRACTICAL QUESTION THAT I'M ASKING YOU. THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING WILL NOT MAKE ANY SENSE UNLESS YOU CAN PUT IT INTO THE
BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME CONTEXT. BUT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE 1107
PROSCRIPTION.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* YEAH.

*THE COURT:* SO TO TELL ME THAT ONE THING MAKES COMMON SENSE DOESN'T
TELL ME HOW I GET AROUND 1107, THE LAST -- 1107(A), THE LAST PHRASE.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* WELL, NO. WHAT I AM SAYING, YOUR HONOR, LET'S SAY -- AND
I HOPE THE COURT WILL NOT DO THAT AND WE BELIEVE THE COURT WILL NOT
EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY. BUT LET'S SAY THAT THE COURT FOR SOME REASON
WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO PUT ON EXPERT TESTIMONY AS TO THE CHARACTERISTICS
OF A BATTERED -- OF A RELATIONSHIP INVOLVING A BATTERED WOMAN BECAUSE
YOU FELT THAT THAT CAME UNDER THE PROSCRIPTION. ISN'T IT STILL POSSIBLE
TO ARGUE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS A
VERY JEALOUS AND POSSESSIVE MAN? THEY ARGUED THAT IN DE MOSS. DE MOSS
WAS AN EARLY CASE. THEY DIDN'T USE EXPERT TESTIMONY THERE. THEY DIDN'T
HAVE THIS TESTIMONY THERE. IN THAT CASE, THE DEFENDANT ALSO MADE
COMMENTS TO THE EFFECT OF, "IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NO ONE WILL." THESE ARE
COMMENTS THAT A JURY CAN UNDERSTAND EVEN IF AN EXPERT DOESN'T EXPLAIN
THEM. WE CALL IT ESTRANGEMENT. WE USE NEW LABELS NOW THAT COME FROM THE
EMPIRICAL LITERATURE AND THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. BUT EVERYONE
UNDERSTANDS THE CONCEPT OF, "IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NO ONE WILL." WE SAY
IT IS ESTRANGEMENT NOW, BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT ON A COMMON SENSE
LEVEL. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS A MAN WHO HAD THE ABSOLUTE NEED
TO CONTROL THIS WOMAN IN EVERY ASPECT OF HER LIFE. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS IS A MAN WHO WAS VERY ABUSIVE TOWARDS THIS WOMAN WITHOUT AN
EXPERT AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN IT FINALLY BECAME APPARENT TO HIM
THAT HE WAS GOING TO LOSE HER, THAT EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD DONE IN THE
PAST THAT HAD WORKED FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONTROLLING HER, THAT HAD KEPT
HER WITH HIM, THAT HAD PREVENTED HER FROM LEAVING WAS NO LONGER WORKING.
AND AROUND THE TIME THAT SHE SENT THAT MESSAGE TO SOJOURN, AROUND THE
TIME THAT SHE MADE THE COMMENTS THAT MADE IT CLEAR, "I AM FINALLY GOING
TO CUT OFF THIS RELATIONSHIP," A JURY CAN UNDERSTAND THAT HIS ONLY --
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS LEFT FOR HIM TO DO AT THAT POINT WAS TO KILL
HER. I MEAN HE HAD TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE. HE HAD TRIED EVERYTHING THAT
COMMON SENSE WOULD INDICATE THAT YOU CAN DO TO CONTROL SOMEONE. HE TRIED
TO TAKE AWAY HER SENSE OF PERSONAL DIGNITY THROUGH THE BELITTLEMENT,
THROUGH THE NAME CALLING. HE TOOK AWAY HER SENSE OF FINANCIAL SECURITY
THROUGH THE IRS LETTER. HE TOOK AWAY HER SENSE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY
THROUGH THE ABUSE AND THE VIOLENCE. AND THEN WHEN THERE WASN'T ANYTHING
ELSE THAT HE COULD THINK OF TO TAKE AWAY FROM HER, HE TOOK AWAY HER
LIFE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE KIND OF A FACT PATTERN THAT A JURY
CAN UNDERSTAND AND CAN APPRECIATE. THEY DO HAVE TO BRING THEIR OWN LIFE
EXPERIENCES AND THEIR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES TO BEAR ON A CASE LIKE
THIS, THE COMMUNITY WISDOM. I THINK WHEN YOU DO THAT -- WHEN THEY DO
THAT, THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THE EVIDENCE. I'M NOT SAYING THAT EXPERT
TESTIMONY WOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE OR RELEVANT. I THINK IT WOULD. MR. GORDON
IS GOING TO DISCUSS THAT FURTHER. I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT IT'S NOT
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. YOUR HONOR, I'D INTENDED NOW TO SWITCH TO THE
ISSUE OF DUE PROCESS, WHICH ISN'T GOING TO TAKE ME VERY LONG, AND I MAY
GET INTO 352 UNLESS THE COURT HAD SOME FURTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE LEFT
COMMON PLAN, SCHEME AND DESIGN.

*THE COURT:* NO, THANK YOU. I'M FAMILIAR WITH EWOLDT, JUSTICE GEORGE'S
OPINION.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* THANK YOU. NOW, THE ISSUE OF DUE PROCESS I DON'T WANT TO
SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON BECAUSE COUNSEL DIDN'T ARGUE IT EXTENSIBLY. WE
BELIEVE THAT THE MATTER IS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCINGLY DISPOSED OF IN
ESTELLE VERSUS MC GUIRE. THAT'S A UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CASE
WHICH, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, IS A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE IN THE
SENSE THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF HIS INFANT
CHILD. THERE WAS TESTIMONY VERY SIMILAR TO THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD
HERE TODAY FROM A NEIGHBOR THAT HEARD -- OVERHEARD THE TYPES OF
ACTIVITIES THAT SHE ASSOCIATED WITH ABUSING THE CHILD. IT WASN'T
DESCRIBED IN THAT MUCH DETAIL BY THE SUPREME COURT, UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT. THERE WAS EVIDENCE IN THAT CASE THAT THE CHILD HAD
SUFFERED A SEVEN-WEEK OLD RIB FRACTURE AND A SIX-WEEK OLD RECTAL TEAR.
AND ALL OF THAT WAS INTRODUCED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. IT ORIGINATED IN
CALIFORNIA FOR THE PURPOSES OF DEMONSTRATING UNDER 1101(B) THE IDENTITY
OF THE PERPETRATOR BECAUSE THE QUESTION WAS, WHO COMMITTED THIS CRIME,
PERPETRATED THIS CRIME ON THIS CHILD. AND THE UNITED STATES SUPREME
COURT SAYS BASICALLY, "ONCE THE EVIDENCE HAS COME IN UNDER STATE
EVIDENTIARY PROVISION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO REEVALUATE IT UNDER THE DUE
PROCESS CLAUSE. THAT'S IT." ONCE IT IS DETERMINED TO BE RELEVANT UNDER
EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101(B), OUR ANALYSIS IS FINISHED. THERE IS NO DUE
PROCESS ANALYSIS, WHICH MEANS THAT THE ONLY CONCERNS THAT ARE IN FRONT
OF YOUR HONOR LEGALLY SPEAKING ARE CALIFORNIA EVIDENTIARY LAW; IN OTHER
WORDS, THE RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES AND 1101(B) AND THEN 352. AND
ONCE YOUR HONOR DISPOSES OF THOSE ISSUES, THERE IS NO INDEPENDENT DUE
PROCESS ARGUMENT. AND MC GUIRE MAKES THAT VERY CLEAR.

*THE COURT:* WELL, IT'S PROBABLY ALSO BECAUSE FEDERAL RULES 403 AND 404
ARE VIRTUALLY CARBON COPIES OF CALIFORNIA'S.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* THAT'S CORRECT. FINALLY, EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 352.
THERE WERE SEVERAL 352 ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY COUNSEL. I AGAIN
POINT BACK TO THE STATUTE ITSELF, 352, BECAUSE WE TEND TO USE SHORTHAND
TERMS TO DESCRIBE IT. AND SOMETIMES WE HEAR ATTORNEYS SAYING MORE
PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE. I BELIEVE I HEARD MR. UELMEN USING THE
PHRASE JUST PREJUDICIAL. HE CUT OUT THE PROBATIVE PART ALTOGETHER. BUT
THAT IS NOT WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS. I MEAN, BOTH ARE MISSTATEMENTS. IT
SAYS THAT IT'S GOT TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE.
AND I CALL THE COURT'S ATTENTION AND RELY ON THAT WORD "SUBSTANTIALLY"
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT WHENEVER WE'RE ENGAGING IN 352 ANALYSIS, BECAUSE
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF IT'S A CLOSE CASE, PROSECUTION WINS. OR EVEN
IF WE WERE TO IMAGINE -- AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THIS IS THE CASE. IT
VERY CLEARLY ISN'T. IF THE COURT WERE OF THE MIND SET IT'S SLIGHTLY MORE
PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE, WE STILL WIN BECAUSE UNLESS IT'S
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE, IT IS NOT EXCLUDABLE
UNDER 352. I WANTED TO DIGRESS FOR JUST ONE SECOND IN THE 352 ARGUMENT,
AND THAT WAS TO MENTION THE CHART THAT WE PREPARED FOR YOUR HONOR TODAY.
YOUR HONOR DIRECTED US TO PREPARE SOMETHING IN WRITING THAT SYNTHESIZED
THE EVIDENCE. AS MS. BODIN POINTED OUT AT THE VERY, VERY BEGINNING OF
HER ANALYSIS AND I BELIEVE MR. GORDON MAY HAVE -- I'M NOT POSITIVE --
ALL OF THE ITEMS THAT WERE CONTAINED IN THE DOCUMENT OF THE
PROSECUTION'S BRIEF, WE DID NOT TAKE THE POSITION THAT ALL OF THEM WERE
ADMISSIBLE IN OUR CASE IN CHIEF. WE SAID WE UNDERSTAND THAT IS NOT THE
CASE. THEY MAY BE ADMISSIBLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES, AND THAT WE WANTED TO
TAKE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIRST LAY OUT EVERYTHING THAT WE KNEW
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP AND WE ALSO WANTED TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT
THE DEFENDANT ON NOTICE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AS TO THE KINDS OF EVIDENCE
THAT WE WERE SEEKING TO INTRODUCE AND ALSO BECAUSE THIS MIGHT COME UP IN
SOME OTHER CONTEXT. WHAT WE WERE DIRECTED TO DO -- AND WE WERE ALL VERY
TIRED LAST NIGHT AFTER THE EVENTS IN COURT AND WE WERE WORKING ON THIS
-- THE DOCUMENT THAT YOUR HONOR HAD ASKED US TO, WE WERE TRYING TO ASK
OURSELVES WHAT IT IS EXACTLY THAT THE JUDGE HAS ASKED US TO DO. AND OUR
INTERPRETATION WAS, HE IS ASKING US TO ELIMINATE THOSE, TO SPECIFY WHICH
ELEMENTS WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE ADMISSIBLE RATHER THAN JUST MAKING A
GENERAL STATEMENT. AND IT WAS ALSO OUR INTERPRETATION THAT IN ESSENCE,
WHAT THE COURT WAS IN A SENSE ASKING US TO DO WAS TO ENGAGE -- AND I MAY
BE WRONG IN THIS -- BUT TO ENGAGE IN OUR OWN 352 ANALYSIS AND TO TAKE
CERTAIN ITEMS WHERE THERE MIGHT BE EXTENSIVE CROSS-EXAMINATION OR
EXTENSIVE IMPEACHMENT OR SO ON THAT WOULDN'T BE AS PROBATIVE TO THE
PROSECUTION'S CASE AND LINE THOSE THROUGH. AND THAT WAS OUR
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE COURT WANTED. SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, AND I'M
NOT SAYING THAT THE COURT DOESN'T HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY ENGAGE IN ITS OWN
ANALYSIS OR THAT THE COURT CAN RELY ON THE PROSECUTION. I'M NOT
SUGGESTING THAT AT ALL. I'M JUST SAYING THAT IN MANY RESPECTS, WE WENT
THROUGH LAST NIGHT THE SAME KIND OF ANALYSIS THAT YOUR HONOR IS GOING TO
BE GOING THROUGH. NOW, THE ISSUE OF PREJUDICE HAS ALSO BEEN WELL DEFINED
BY THE CASE LAW. AND WE KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT TERM. THEY DON'T
MEAN EVIDENCE WHICH TENDS TO INCRIMINATE THE DEFENDANT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
ALL EVIDENCE THAT WE'RE INTRODUCING IS SUPPOSED TO ACCOMPLISH THAT END.
IT HAS BEEN DEFINED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN PEOPLE VERSUS
THOMPSON -- I CAN'T RECALL WHETHER WE CITED THAT IN OUR CASE. IT'S AT 27
CAL. 3D. AT PAGE 317 -- 27 CAL. 3D. 317 WHERE THEY SAID THAT:

"IT IS THE TENDENCY TO CONDEMN NOT BECAUSE HE IS BELIEVED GUILTY OF THE
PRESENT CHARGE, BUT BECAUSE HE HAS ESCAPED UNPUNISHED FROM OTHER
OFFENSES," END QUOTE. AND THAT IS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE CASE OF EWOLDT.
SO THE IDEA IS THAT IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE JURY
MAY DEVELOP THE MIND SET THAT, "THIS GUY HAS GOTTEN AWAY WITH THIS KIND
OF THING BEFORE, AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE THAT HE'S GUILTY NOW, BUT I
WANT TO PUNISH HIM FOR WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE. SO I AM GOING TO VOTE
GUILTY ANYWAY." THAT IS THE KIND OF STATE OF MIND THAT WE ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PREJUDICE IN THE CONTEXT OF 352 AND 1101(B)
CASES. NOW, IF THERE WAS EVER A CASE WHERE YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE
TRUE, YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE PEOPLE VERSUS EWOLDT, WHERE, ACCORDING
TO MY CALCULATION, I THINK THERE WAS 12 YEARS -- AND I DID IT BASED ON
THE AGES OF THE CHILDREN. SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I COULD BE A LITTLE BIT
OFF, BUT PROBABLY NOT FAR -- THERE WAS 12 YEARS BETWEEN THE ACTS OF
MOLESTATION OF THE FIRST CHILD AND ACTS OF MOLESTATION IN THE CHARGED
OFFENSE, AND HE WAS NEVER TRIED AND CONVICTED OF THE PRIOR OFFENSE. AND
COUNSEL CITED THIS FOR THE PROPOSITION -- THIS CASE FOR THE PROPOSITION
DEFINING PREJUDICE THE WAY THAT I JUST HAVE. AND YOU WOULD THINK FROM
THAT THAT EWOLDT SAID, WELL, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD, WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS
EVIDENCE. I MEAN, IF THERE'S EVER A CASE WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE
PREJUDICE, THE FACT THEY KNOW THIS GUY IS ESSENTIALLY A PERVERT WHO DID
EXACTLY THE SAME THING 12 YEARS EARLIER AND WAS NEVER PUNISHED FOR IT
MIGHT CAUSE THEM TO VOTE GUILTY HERE. YET, THE COURT NEVERTHELESS FOUND
THAT THE PRIOR INSTANCE WAS GOING TO COME IN. WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT HERE
IN THIS ANALYSIS, YOUR HONOR, IS THE -- IN A WAY, THE VERY ARGUMENTS OF
COUNSEL YESTERDAY UNDERCUT HIS 352 ARGUMENT BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT
HE HAS ARGUED THAT THESE INSTANCES CAN BE MINIMIZED, EXPLAINED, THAT
THEY'RE AMBIGUOUS, THEY DON'T REALLY PROVE WHAT WE SAY THAT THEY PROVE,
ARE WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT A CASE WHERE THE JURY IS GOING TO SAY, "GEE,
I REALLY DON'T THINK ORENTHAL SIMPSON COMMITTED THAT MURDER. BUT HE DID
SO MANY OTHER BAD THINGS THAT HE WASN'T CONVICTED OF, I'M JUST GOING TO
CONVICT HIM OF A DOUBLE HOMICIDE ANYWAY"? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
CONCERNED ABOUT HERE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT A REASONABLE INTERPRETATION
OF THE KINDS OF EVIDENCE THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO INTRODUCE IS -- LENDS
ITSELF TO THAT KIND OF FEAR OR THAT KIND OF CONCERN. THE NEXT 352 TYPE
OF ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE WAS THE ISSUE OF TIME CONSUMPTION AND JUDICIAL
EFFICIENCY. AND I JUST POINT OUT THAT ALL OF THESE RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE
CASES SINCE 1909 ALLOWED THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY
IMPLIEDLY DECIDED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO ALLOW IN,
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT IT TAKES TIME TO PROVE THESE PRIOR INSTANCES.

*THE COURT:* BUT IN THOSE OTHER CASES, THEY'RE NORMALLY TALKING ABOUT
ONE OR TWO OTHER INSTANCES WHERE HERE THERE IS SORT OF A LAUNDRY LIST OF
ITEMS. I MEAN, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 12 OR 15 MISDEMEANOR JURY TRIALS
WITHIN THIS TRIAL, AREN'T WE?

*MR. GOLDBERG:* WELL, IN SOME YOU CAN'T TELL HOW MANY THERE WERE BECAUSE
THEY SIMPLY SAY THERE WAS A HISTORY OF ABUSE OR A HISTORY OF ANTAGONISM.
THEY USE LANGUAGE THAT DOESN'T REALLY ALLOW YOU NECESSARILY TO DETERMINE
WHAT ALL THE SPECIFIC INSTANCES WERE. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A FEW SPECIFIC
INSTANCES WHICH ARE HIGHLY PROBATIVE AND WE HAVE MANY OTHER INSTANCES
THAT AREN'T. AND THAT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE MANY INSTANCES. BUT IT ALSO
IN A SENSE, YOUR HONOR, HELPS US OUT ON THE 352 CONCERN. BECAUSE THE
ARGUMENT AGAINST THE ADMISSION OF THE EVIDENCE, ONE OF THE STRONGEST
ARGUMENTS WOULD BE, IF YOU COULD SAY, THIS IS JUST AN ISOLATED INSTANCE,
IF THERE WERE ONE SLAP AT ONE POINT IN THE HISTORY OF A RELATIONSHIP,
THEN YOU COULD ARGUE UNDER 352, WELL, DOES THIS REALLY SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP ITSELF? WHAT THE PROSECUTION HAS SAID THAT WE ARE
TRYING TO DO IS, WE ARE TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP.
WE ARE USING THE SPECIFIC INSTANCES TO ALLOW THE JURY TO MAKE CERTAIN
INFERENCES AND DEDUCTIONS ABOUT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP IT WAS. AND THE
VERY FACT THAT IT DID GO OVER AN EXTENSIVE PERIOD OF TIME COMPLETELY
ELIMINATES ANY ARGUMENT THAT THIS WAS SOME SORT OF TRANSITORY PROBLEM
THAT EXISTED, WAS LIMITED TO A YEAR OR TWO AND WENT AWAY. IT COMPLETELY
ELIMINATES ANY ARGUMENT OR ANY INFERENCE OTHER THAN THAT THIS WAS AN
INALIENABLE PART OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE
VICTIM IN THIS CASE. SO IN MANY WAYS, YES, YOUR HONOR, WE DO HAVE MANY
INSTANCES. AND THAT MEANS THAT IT WILL TAKE MORE TIME, BUT IT ALSO MEANS
THAT THE EVIDENCE IS MUCH MORE PROBATIVE, AND THEREFORE, WE MAKE A MUCH
BETTER SHOWING ON THE PROBATIVE SIDE OF THIS TWO-PART 352 SCALE. AND
WHAT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT THE TIME CONSUMPTION CASES
TYPICALLY ARE DEALING WITH SITUATIONS WHERE THE EVIDENCE IS COLLATERAL,
WHERE IT DOESN'T GO TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE. WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS
THAT FUNDAMENTALLY, THIS IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDER. THE RELATIONSHIP
IS ITSELF PART OF THE TRANSACTION IN THIS CASE AND EXPLAINS WHAT
HAPPENED. THIS IS THE CASE. THIS ISN'T SOME SIDE ISSUE, NOT LIKE A
CREDIBILITY ISSUE WHICH IS A COLLATERAL TYPE OF ISSUE IN CRIMINAL
PROCEEDINGS. IT GOES TO THE VERY HEART AND CORE. THE SUPREME COURT IN
NICHOLAS SAID, ACTUALLY GOES TO ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF OUR CHARGE. I
GUESS THAT THE DEFENDANT WILL PROBABLY SPEND MONTHS AND MONTHS ON THE
DNA EVIDENCE AND THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE ON THAT CASE, CROSS EXAMINE AD
NAUSEAM, AND I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT TO CUT A
LOT OF THAT OUT UNDER 352 BECAUSE AGAIN, IT REALLY DOES GO TO A VERY
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE CASE. AND USUALLY WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT,
352, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT STUFF THAT'S COLLATERAL. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT
I HEAR IN THE ARGUMENT WHEN MR. UELMEN IS TALKING ABOUT TIME CONSUMPTION
-- THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CALL ALL THESE WITNESSES, REBUTTAL,
CROSS-EXAMINE -- IS ALMOST A FORM OF LEGAL BLACKMAIL. THAT IS TO SAY TO
THE JUDGE, YOUR HONOR, WE ARE GOING TO PUT ON SO MUCH EVIDENCE AND HAVE
SO MUCH CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THESE WITNESSES THAT UNDER THIS
TIME-CONSUMPTION CONCERN, WE SHOULD EXCLUDE THE EVIDENCE. AND I JUST
DON'T BELIEVE, YOUR HONOR, THAT IT'S PROPER TO MAKE THAT KIND OF
ARGUMENT OR THAT YOUR HONOR OR THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE IN A SENSE HELD
HOSTAGE BY WHAT THE DEFENSE PROPOSES TO DO.

*THE COURT:* I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT IT'S A MATTER OF A BLACKMAIL OR
THREATENING. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THAT ARGUMENT OR I'M NOT CONCERNED
THAT THAT ARGUMENT WOULD BE CONSTRUED AS BEING BLACKMAIL OR HOLDING THE
COURT HOSTAGE OR WHATEVER. BUT I DO HAVE A VERY PRACTICAL PROBLEM. THAT
I'VE GOT 24 JURORS PROBABLY PLAYING TIDDLEDYWINKS RIGHT NOW WITH EACH
OTHER. I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT WE GET THESE MOTIONS IF I'M CONCERNED
THAT WE FINISH THESE MOTIONS THIS WEEK, LET ALONE HAVE TO TRY 12
INCIDENTS AS MISDEMEANOR JURY TRIALS WITHIN THIS TRIAL AND I'VE GOT A
SEQUESTERED JURY THAT'S COSTING ME THOUSANDS OF BUCKS A DAY TO HOUSE, I
MEAN IT IS A REAL PROBLEM, A REAL PRACTICAL PROBLEM; THE STAMINA AND THE
ABILITY OF OUR TRIAL JURORS TO HANG IN THERE WITH US. I MEAN I GET PAID
TO BE HERE EVERY DAY. THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM. BUT THEY DON'T.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* I UNDERSTAND THAT, YOUR HONOR. AND AS I SAID BY WAY OF
ANALOGY, IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A PROBLEM THAT THE DEFENSE IS PROBABLY
GOING TO SPEND AND THE PROSECUTION WITHOUT ANY DOUBT REGARD TO BEING AN
INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME ON MANY OF THE OTHER ISSUES ON THE CASE SUCH
AS HOW IS EVERY OTHER SAMPLE OF EVIDENCE COLLECTED AND WHAT KIND OF
DISTILLED WATER WAS USED AND WHAT WERE THE LABELS AND EVERY LITTLE TYPE
OF TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR, SO ON. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT A
DECISION HAS TO BE MADE HOW CENTRAL IS THIS TO THE PROSECUTION'S CASE OR
TO THE DEFENDANT'S CASE. AND ALL I'M SAYING IS, WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
TIME-CONSUMPTION ISSUES, THAT WE ARE TYPICALLY TALKING ABOUT CASES AND
SCENARIOS WHERE THE EVIDENCE IN QUESTION DOESN'T GO TO THE HEART OF THE
MATTER. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE TIME IN THIS
CASE. BUT THE ISSUE IS HOW IMPORTANT AND HOW CENTRAL ARE THEY.

*THE COURT:* I'M JUST RAISING TO YOU THE PRACTICAL CONCERN. I UNDERSTAND
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN COLLATERAL AND SUBSTANTIVE.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* OKAY. FINALLY, I'D JUST LIKE TO ADDRESS THE REMOTENESS
ISSUE. THAT'S MY LAST 352 ISSUE, AND THEN I'LL BE FINISHED. IS THAT
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CASES THAT DEAL WITH REMOTENESS. ONE WAS PEOPLE
VERSUS SHAVER, WHERE THE DEFENDANT MURDERED HIS WIFE, AND EVIDENCE WAS
INTRODUCED THAT TWO YEARS BEFORE, HE FALSELY ACCUSED HIS WIFE OF
SLEEPING WITH ANOTHER MAN. AND IN THE INTERVENING TWO YEARS, THE COURT
SAID THAT INSOFAR AS THE RECORD WAS CONCERNED, THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS AT
ALL. SO THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE A PROBLEMATIC CASE IN THE SENSE THAT YOU
HAVE THAT TWO-YEAR GAP, SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE IN OUR CASE.
BUT THE COURT HELD THAT REMOTENESS OF THIS EVIDENCE MIGHT LESSEN ITS
WEIGHT, BUT DID NOT RENDER INADMISSIBLE. SO IT'S AN ISSUE THAT GOES TO
WEIGHT, NOT ADMISSIBILITY. WE HAD PEOPLE VERSUS HELFEND, WHICH I ALREADY
DISCUSSED. THAT WAS THE CASE WHERE THE EX-HUSBAND KILLED HIS WIFE'S NEW
HUSBAND. AND THE EVIDENCE THERE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD. AND THAT OF COURSE,
THE EWOLDT CASE ITSELF WHERE THE EVIDENCE WAS 12 YEARS OLD, AND IT WAS
ALLOWED IN NEVERTHELESS. MAY I JUST HAVE A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR, TO REVIEW
MY NOTES?

*THE COURT:* WELL, LET ME ASK A QUESTION ON THAT LAST POINT.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* YEAH.

*THE COURT:* YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO GO BACK 17 YEARS ALL THE WAY BACK TO
AN INCIDENT BACK IN 1977. DON'T I ALSO HAVE TO WEIGH IN THIS REMOTENESS
PROCESS THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THAT INCIDENT VERSUS HOW REMOTE IT IS
VERSUS HOW MUCH TIME IT'S GOING TO TAKE? I MEAN, AREN'T THEY ALL
CONSIDERATIONS THAT I HAVE TO CONSIDER?

*MR. GOLDBERG:* YOUR HONOR, THE COURT HAS TO CONSIDER THE TOTALITY OF
THE FACTS. I THINK IT'S HARD TO SAY WHICH FACTS ARE TOTALLY IRRELEVANT.
WHAT WAS SIGNIFICANT THOUGH IN THE EWOLDT CASE THAT I THINK ADDRESSES
THE COURT'S CONCERN, WE HAD A VERY OLD CRIME --

*THE COURT:* THAT'S THE IDENTICAL CRIME. SO THE PROBATIVE VALUE IS
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHEN YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF CONDUCT THAT'S
RELATED, BUT NOT THE SAME CONDUCT.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* OKAY. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY STRESS THERE AND I
THINK IT IS JUST A POINT THAT THE COURT -- I WOULD ASK THE COURT TO
CONSIDER IN YOUR HONOR'S ANALYSIS. AND I'M NOT SAYING THE COURT DOESN'T
HAVE TO GO THROUGH ITS ANALYSIS. YOU DO. THE THING THAT THEY MENTION IN
EWOLDT WHERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT REMOTENESS, THEY SAID, "LOOK, WE
KNOW THIS IS 12 YEARS OLD. BUT WHAT WE FIND TO BE SIGNIFICANT IS THAT
SHORTLY AFTER THE DEFENDANT STOPPED MOLESTING THE OLDER CHILD, HE
STARTED MOLESTING THE YOUNGER CHILD." SO THERE WASN'T A GAP. SO THAT
LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE FROM THAT CASE AND FROM OTHERS THAT WHAT THE COURTS
ARE PRIMARILY CONCERNED ABOUT ARE GAPS. NOT NECESSARILY HOW OLD THE
EVIDENCE IS, BUT ARE THERE ANY REAL GAPS OF A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME
THAT SHOWS PERHAPS THE DEFENDANT'S CHARACTER HAS CHANGED IN BETWEEN THE
TIME THE EARLIER EVENTS OCCURRED AND THE LATER EVENTS OCCURRED. AND AS I
SAID, YOUR HONOR, I UNDERSTAND THE COURT'S ARGUMENT THAT YEAH, IT'S
OLDER; THEREFORE, LESS PROBATIVE. BUT THERE'S A COUNTERVAILING ARGUMENT;
AND THAT COUNTERVAILING ARGUMENT IS THE FACT THAT WE CAN SHOW THAT THIS
WAS A PART OF THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTED AT THE GENESIS OF THE
RELATIONSHIP. IT WAS A PART OF THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTED WHEN THE
DEFENDANT PHYSICALLY TERMINATED THE RELATIONSHIP BY KILLING THE VICTIM,
AND EVERYWHERE IN-BETWEEN MAKES THE EVIDENCE INFINITELY MORE PROBATIVE
THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE BE BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES KNOW THAT THIS IS A
FUNDAMENTAL, AS I SAY, INALIENABLE ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE DEFENDANT AND NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. I JUST RECEIVED A NOTE ON THE
ZACK ANALYSIS, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE ANSWER, ONE OF THE ANSWERS TO
YOUR HONOR'S QUESTION IS THAT ZACK WAS A RETRIAL, AT WHICH THE COURT
GRANTED THE PEOPLE'S MOTION TO HAVE THE EVIDENCE INTRODUCED IN ITS CASE
IN CHIEF. SO THAT WOULD -- IF TRUE -- AND I HATE EVER SAYING SOMETHING
WITHOUT RELOOKING AGAIN -- WOULD DISPOSE OF THAT CONCERN. BUT I DON'T
THINK THAT'S A MAJOR CONCERN THERE.

*THE COURT:* YOU MEAN YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO JUSTICE YEAGEN ABOUT THAT?
MEAN, OUT OF CURIOSITY, HOW DID WE COME BY THAT INFORMATION?

(DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. GOLDBERG:* WELL, I GUESS THIS WAS ANOTHER ONE OF THE WONDERS OF
TECHNOLOGY. SOME LAW PROFESSOR APPARENTLY CAUSED THIS TO BE SENT TO THE
PROSECUTION IN TIME FOR THE CLOSING OF MY ARGUMENT TODAY. THE --

*THE COURT:* TIMING IS EVERYTHING.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* YES, IT IS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, YOUR HONOR, VERY SIMPLY,
THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE COMES IN. WE HAVE A VERY LENGTHY HISTORY OF IT
COMING IN IN CALIFORNIA. WHETHER YOU WANT TO SAY IT'S A DISTINCT MOTIVE
ANALYSIS DEALING WITH RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES, WHETHER YOU WANT TO
CHARACTERIZE IT AS 1101(B) ANALYSIS, IT COMES IN. AND AS STATED BY THE
COURT IN PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK, A TRIAL IS A SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH. AND I
THINK WHAT WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED TODAY, THAT TO DENY THE JURY THE
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR THIS EVIDENCE IS NOT SIMPLY TO HIDE THE TRUTH FROM
THE JURY, BUT IT IS TO AFFIRMATIVELY CAUSE THEM TO MAKE CERTAIN
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THIS CASE THAT ARE THE OPPOSITE OF THE TRUTH. IT IS --
AS WE'VE STATED BEFORE, TRULY IT'S A PERPETRATED FRAUD ON THE JURY. YOUR
HONOR, WE BELIEVE THAT LEGALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT LOGICALLY AND, AS MR.
GORDON IS ABOUT TO SAY, EVEN EMPIRICALLY, THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE IS
RELEVANT AND IT IS ADMISSIBLE. THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

*MR. GORDON:* GOOD AFTERNOON, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALREADY?

*MR. GORDON:* WELL, CLOSE. IT JUST FEELS THAT WAY. AND I'LL TRY TO RUN A
352 ANALYSIS ON MYSELF TO KEEP THIS BRIEF.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. GORDON:* I WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE ISSUES TO THE COURT. THE FIRST
ONE RELATES TO WHAT THE SOCIAL SCIENCE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ARGUED
IN THIS MOTION AND BY THE DEFENSE IN THEIR BRIEF AND HOW THEY ARE
RELEVANT TO SEVERAL NOTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ARGUED BACK AND FORTH AND ARE
VERY KEY TO THE COURT MAKING ITS DECISION HERE. SO PRESENT SOME
INFORMATION TO THE COURT WITH REGARD TO A LOT OF THE ISSUES WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT IN THE EMPIRICAL REALM TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS HERE. SO
ISOLATED SOLELY TO THIS MOTION, HOPEFULLY GIVE THE ORDER SOME EVIDENCE
WITH REGARD TO THAT. THEN SECONDLY, GOING TO ANALYSIS WITH REGARD TO THE
USES OF EXPERT TESTIMONY IN A TRIAL IN THIS MATTER AND ADDRESS SOME OF
THE COURT'S CONCERNS WITH REGARD TO 1107. AND WITH REGARD TO THE USE OF
EXPERT TESTIMONY, AGAIN, I THINK THIS IS A POINT SIMILAR TO RAISING THE
MULTIPLE ISSUES YESTERDAY. WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE INTRODUCTION
OF EXPERT TESTIMONY WITHIN THIS TYPE OF TRIAL OR A SEXUAL ASSAULT TRIAL
OR CHILD ABUSE TRIAL CAN BE TRIGGERED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS WITHIN
A TRIAL. AND I THINK THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE TO
CONSIDER IN THE TRIAL. ONE IS WHAT I CALL KIND OF THE PHILLIPS, CEGERS,
MCALPIN ANALYSIS THAT TALK ABOUT WHAT IS USED IN CASE IN CHIEF. SECOND
IS THE TRADITIONAL BLEDSOE, BALKER ARIS ANALYSIS WHICH IS MORE OF A
REBUTTAL TYPE OF USE OF AN EXPERT WHICH CAN OCCUR IN THE CASE IN CHIEF
OR IN REBUTTAL, DEPENDING WHAT OCCURS BY THE DEFENSE, DEPENDING UPON THE
CROSS-EXAMINATION, ARGUMENTS, WHAT INFERENCES ARE RAISED WHEN THAT TRIAL
OCCURRED. AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK WE BROUGHT THIS UP IN THIS
BRIEF NOW IS -- AND TO ARGUE AND PUT THIS BEFORE THE COURT NOW, THAT
MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE, ESPECIALLY THE SOCIAL SCIENCE
ARGUMENTS, BUT MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS MADE IN THE DEFENDANT'S BRIEF AND
CERTAINLY THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE YESTERDAY BY DEAN UELMEN ARE
EXACTLY, EXACTLY THE KIND OF MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHAT OCCURS TO A
BATTERED WOMAN, WHICH REFERS TO ADDRESSED BY LENORE WALKER IN 1979 IN
THIS BOOK, THE BATTERED WOMAN, WHICH HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN NUMEROUS
CASES BY THE COURT AND BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO IF THOSE ARE QUOTED HERE
WITH EXPECTATION THAT THOSE WILL BE EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF ARGUMENTS
IN CROSS-EXAMINATION THAT WOULD OCCUR IN THIS CASE, IT WOULD TRIGGER --
SO MUCH OF THAT IS GEARED TOWARD THAT. AND WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT
THERE MAY BE A TRIGGERING MECHANISM THAT MUST OCCUR. NEXT IS 1107 AND
THE EFFECT OF 1107 ON THIS AREA IN GENERAL. AND THEN LASTLY IS A STOLL
SITUATION WHICH, AS IN PEOPLE VERSUS STOLL, AGAIN REQUIRING THE
TRIGGERING MIGHT OCCUR DEPENDING ON THE DEFENSE WOULD BRING FORTH EXPERT
TESTIMONY IN THEIR CASE. I'M NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THAT ONE. I JUST
WANTED TO BRING IT TO THE COURT'S ATTENTION BECAUSE IT'S A SEPARATE
SITUATION THAT MAY OCCUR, AND WE CAN TAKE IT UP AT THAT TIME. BUT I DO
THINK WE NEED TO LIKE -- WE NEED TO ANALYZE THESE IN THESE DISCREET
SECTIONS. AND IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT'S OCCURRING
HERE IN THIS MOTION AND SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE AND
WHAT THEY ARE BEING SAID BOTH IN A LEGAL WAY, WHEN THE COURT MAKES ITS
DETERMINATION, THE FACTS THAT THE COURT IS GOING TO BE BASING IT ON, BUT
ALSO SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT POLICY ARGUMENTS. AS DEAN UELMEN WAS CARRYING
HIS FILE AROUND WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT, I MYSELF WASN'T QUITE
FAR ALONG. I WAS AT THE LOWER END OF THE -- LOWER IS NOT THE WORD -- THE
END OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ON THE STREET PUSHING A PATROL CAR
AROUND. AND I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OUT THERE. AND A
COUPLE THINGS I LEARNED AS A POLICE OFFICER, PATROLMAN OUT THERE WAS,
ONE, TO BE REAL CAREFUL AT THOSE CALLS BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY DANGEROUS
AND VERY VIOLENT, EXPLOSIVE SITUATIONS. NUMBER TWO, WHAT I LEARNED IS IF
IN MY BEAT THERE WAS A HOUSE OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCES GOING ON, UNLESS I
INTERVENED, I WAS GOING TO BE SPENDING A LOT OF TIMES THERE BECAUSE I
WAS GOING TO GET CALLS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND THE OTHER THING
I LEARNED WAS THAT SOME OF THE WORST ASSAULTS THAT I SAW, SOME OF THE
WORST HOMICIDES I SAW AS A PATROLMAN WERE OUT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
CALLS. I LEARNED THAT AS A COP OUT ON THE STREET AND SQUATTED ALL MY
TIME ON PATROL. AND WHAT KIND OF AMAZED ME WHEN I CAME INTO COURT, WHERE
WE TAKE A MUCH MORE SCHOLARLY APPROACH HOPEFULLY TO THINGS THAN SAY
PATROLMEN DO OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TALKING ABOUT THINGS, AT
LEAST THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO -- BUT WHAT I SAW IS THAT OF THE
REALITIES THAT I LEARNED OUT THERE WERE NOT ONLY IGNORED, BUT IN FACT
WERE TRIVIALIZED AND MINIMIZED IN COURT AND OCCURRED ALL THE TIME.
THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING WE'RE HEARING YESTERDAY. WHAT HAPPENS OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO WOMEN IN THIS SOCIETY IS, WE SAY, LOOK, WE
UNDERSTAND THAT BATTERING IS A PROBLEM, AND YOU NEED TO BRING THAT
PROBLEM WITHIN THIS SYSTEM. AND WHEN YOU GET IN THE SYSTEM, WE ARE --
THIS IS THE PLACE TO TAKE CARE OF IT. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS GOING TO
RESPOND TO IT. AND THEN LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE JUST IN THIS
MOTION TODAY. IN THE WORST POSSIBLE SITUATION FOR BATTERED WOMAN, AND
WHEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DIDN'T RESPOND ADEQUATELY, IT RESULTED IN HER
DEATH. WE ARE HERE AND THIS ARGUMENT IS REVOLVING AROUND WHETHER THOSE
EXPERIENCES WHICH GO TO THE VERY HEART AND DRIVE EVERY SINGLE THING THAT
OCCURRED IN THIS CASE EVEN COME HERE, EVEN COME IN BEFORE THIS JURY WHO
WILL BE JUDGING THE BATTERER WHO TOOK THIS WOMAN'S LIFE, WHETHER THEY
COME IN OR NOT. AND I THINK THOSE ARE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT NEED TO
BE KIND OF IMPRINTED OVER THIS. NOW, WITH REGARD TO THE SOCIAL SCIENCE
ARGUMENT THAT IS PRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE -- AND THERE IS AN ARGUMENT
THAT WAS PRESENTED THAT THIS BASICALLY IS NUMERIC ANALYSIS, THAT THE
COURT CANNOT -- SHOULD NOT CONSIDER SIMILARITIES. THIS IS WITHOUT
GETTING TO THE POWER AND CONTROL WHEEL AT ALL. IT'S JUST ON A VERY
NUMERIC SIMILARITY. THAT -- THERE'S TWO -- I THINK THE NUMBERS WERE,
THERE WERE 2.5 MILLION WOMEN BATTERED IN THE UNITED STATES LAST YEAR AND
THERE WERE ONLY -- AND I ABSOLUTELY HATED READING THAT WORD AND I DON'T
LIKE SAYING IT, BUT THERE WAS ONLY 2,000 WOMEN THAT WERE KILLED;
THEREFORE, THERE'S NO CONNECTION. THERE'S A COUPLE PROBLEMS FROM THAT
ANALYSIS. NUMBER ONE IS, JUST LOGICALLY, TO USE THE SAME ANALYSIS, ONE
COULD ARGUE THAT WELL, THERE'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OCCURRENCES OF SEX
WITHIN THIS COUNTRY EVERY YEAR; YET ONLY A FRACTION OF THE PEOPLE
ENGAGING IN SEX GET PREGNANT. NO LINKS THERE. THAT'S THE SAME KIND OF
ANALYSIS THAT'S BEING MADE. WHAT THE DEFENSE HAS DONE -- WHAT PRODDER
(PHONETIC) SHOWS US IN HIS ANALYSIS, WHAT HE HAS DONE, HE'S TAKEN
SOMETHING CALLED THE CONFLICT TACTIC SCALE. AND THAT IS A SCALE THAT IS
USED TO EVALUATE ABUSIVENESS BY A BATTERER TOWARDS HIS OR HER SPOUSE.
THERE ARE MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE FACTS ALONG THAT SCALE THAT MEASURE THE
LEVEL OF BATTERING. HE USED ONE, ONE OF THE FACTORS OUT OF THAT AND THEN
SAID, "THAT'S THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO COMPARE. WE ARE GOING
TO TAKE ONE PERSON WHICH HAS ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL CONTACT AT ALL, THAT
ONE ELEMENT, AND THAT IS THE BASE POPULATION OF BATTERERS WE ARE GOING
TO LOOK AT COMPARED TO HOMICIDES." THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU DO THAT. IF
YOU JUST USE THAT ONE SCALE, THE CONFLICT TACTIC SCALE, AND YOU SEE
MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE FACTORS, PRESENTING EVIDENCE HOPEFULLY LATER TO
DESTROY A MORE DETAIL OF THAT, YOU REDUCE THAT POPULATION GEOMETRY TO
GET DOWN TO THE POPULATION THAT SHOULD BE COMPARED. BUT THAT'S NOT --
YOU GET TO SOMETHING CALLED THE TOTAL LOP SCALE, AND THE SCALE IS A
SCALE THAT THERE'S EMOTIONAL ABUSE THAT IS ADDED ON TOP OF THAT. AND
WHEN YOU HAVE INSTANCES OF EMOTIONAL ABUSE ON TOP OF THE PHYSICAL ACTS
THAT HAVE OCCURRED WITHIN THE CONFLICT TACTIC SCALE, YOU HAVE EVEN A
SMALLER POPULATION, ONCE AGAIN DECREASING THAT POPULATION THAT'S
COMPARED TO HOMICIDES AND INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OR NUMBERS, IF THEY
WANT TO USE NUMBER GEOMETRY. YOU THEN GO TO A DOCUMENT CALLED
INTRUSIVENESS SCALE. AND THE INTRUSIVENESS SCALE MEASURES STALKING.
STALKING IS AN PHENOMENALLY, PHENOMENALLY IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR WHEN
LOOKING AT INSTANCES OF BATTERING AND BATTERING RELATIONSHIPS. THE
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN YOU HAVE STALKING BEHAVIOR, THE RISK RATIO
GOES UP PHENOMENALLY, AND ON TOP OF THAT, THAT POPULATION OF BATTERERS
WE HAVE GOES DOWN GEOMETRICALLY. LASTLY, GOING TO --

*THE COURT:* THIS IS BEGINNING TO SOUND LIKE DNA ARGUMENT.

*MR. GORDON:* SORRY. WELL, MY OFFICE IS CLOSE TO LISA KAHN. SO MAYBE
IT'S KIND OF RUBBING OFF. SORRY. THEN GO TO -- WELL, YOU THEN GO TO THE
DIETZ THREATS SCALE. AND THE DIETZ THREATS SCALE IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS
AT ACTUAL RISK AND LOOKS AT RISK FACTORS. AND IN THE DIETZ SCALE, THERE
ARE SEVERAL PREDICTORS OF VIOLENCE. AND WHAT IT SAYS IS, IF A DEFENDANT
OR A POTENTIAL BATTERER HAS ANY ONE, ANY ONE OF THE FACTORS IN THAT
DIETZ SCALE, THEY ARE 50 PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT -- I THINK HE
USES THE TERM AN "ATROCIOUS CRIME" SUCH AS A HOMICIDE. IN THIS CASE,
THERE ARE FOUR ON THAT PRIMARY. SO IF WE WERE GOING TO USE THE PROPER
NUMERIC ANALYSIS, WHAT WE WOULD FIND IS THAT THE POPULATION THAT WE GOT
DOWN TO WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE FACTS THAT WE HAVE HERE COMPARED TO THE
NUMBER OF HOMICIDES IS A MUCH SMALLER PORTION OF BATTERERS. AND NOT ONLY
IS THE NUMBERS GAME MUCH, MUCH CLOSER AND SHOW A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP,
BUT THAT IN FACT, WHEN LOOKING AT THE -- WHAT WE HAD OCCUR IN THIS CASE,
THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS AT VERY, VERY HIGH RISK AT ALL TIMES. AND
AGAIN, I DON'T PROPOSE TO USE THAT ANALYSIS AND THAT'S NOT TESTIMONY I
EXPECT TO BE PRESENTED IN TRIAL AND THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M SUGGESTING THE
EXPERT WOULD TESTIFY TO AT TRIAL IN THE FORM OF ANALYSIS. I JUST WANT TO
RESPOND TO THE SOCIAL SCIENCE ARGUMENT HERE, AND I THINK THERE'S
INFORMATION THAT THE COURT NEEDS TO HAVE TO EVALUATE MANY OF THE
ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IN ANALYZING THIS TESTIMONY. ONE OF
THE CONCERNS I HAVE IN INTERCHANGE BETWEEN MR. GOLDBERG AND THE COURT
WITH REGARD TO OUR ANALYSIS OF THESE INCIDENTS IS THAT WHAT WE PROPOSE
TO TALK ABOUT WITHIN THAT POWER AND CONTROL WHEEL, THAT ANALYSIS OF
POWER AND CONTROL WE THINK IS AN ARGUMENT THAT CERTAINLY CAN BE MADE
WITH LOGIC AND COMMON SENSE. THAT WHEN ONE VIEWS THESE VARIOUS ACTS
WITHIN A RUBRIC OF POWER AND CONTROL, THAT ONE BY COMMON SENSE CAN SEE
THAT THEY ARE ALL CONTROL MECHANISMS, THAT THAT'S THE LOGICAL INFERENCE.
ONE CAN SEE HOW THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEHAVIORS WHEN LINED UP WITHIN
A POWER AND CONTROL ANALYSIS CERTAINLY HAVE THAT -- THEY ARE MECHANISMS
OF POWER AND CONTROL. AND WHEN VIEWING WHAT THE DEFENDANT DID IN THIS
CASE, THAT THIS POWER AND CONTROL IN FACT ESCALATED. AND WITHOUT GETTING
TO ANY EXPERT ANALYSIS AT ALL, JUST BY MAPPING WHAT OCCURRED HERE, BY
LAYING IT OUT AND MAPPING IT AND LOOKING AT THE KEY EVENTS, THAT WE
WOULD ARGUE TO THE JURY, BECAUSE THIS IS THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED,
THAT THIS POWER AND CONTROL ESCALATED UNTIL THIS TERMINAL ACT OF
CONTROL. NOW, I THINK CERTAINLY HAVING EXPERT TESTIMONY TO EXPLAIN THAT
IN MUCH MORE ARTICULATE TERMS THAN I CAN AND WITH A BETTER -- CERTAINLY
A BETTER FOUNDATION CERTAINLY, CERTAINLY HELPS, IS GOING TO HELP THE
TRIER OF FACT. AND I THINK THERE ARE WAYS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN
THEORIES THAT THAT CAN COME IN. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE WANTS ME TO
BREAK NOW OR KEEP GOING.

*THE COURT:* WELL, YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES WORTH OF COMMENTS.

*MR. GORDON:* OKAY. I'LL KEEP GOING. THE FIRST IS, UNDER THE TRADITIONAL
BLEDSOE, BOWKER AND ARIS CASE. AND WHAT THOSE THREE CASES, BLEDSOE
DEALING WITH RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME, BOWKER DEALING WITH CHILD ABUSE
ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME, ARIS DEALING WITH BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME,
TALK ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE PROSECUTION -- ARIS WAS ACTUALLY THE
DEFENSE INTRODUCING THE CASE -- BUT THE ABILITY TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE TO
DISABUSE THE TRIER OF FACT OF MISCONCEPTIONS THAT ARE HELD ABOUT THE
ISSUE AT BAR. ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE THAT THE COURT RAISED WAS
DISCUSSING 1107. I WILL GET TO 1107 IN A MINUTE. BUT THAT A NOTION THAT
1107 -- THIS WAS AN ARGUMENT ADVANCED BY THE DEFENSE -- THE PRESCRIPTION
IN 1107(A) SOMEHOW TOOK OVER ALL EXPERT TESTIMONY ANALYSIS WITH REGARD
TO ANY ISSUE WITH REGARD TO BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME. I WANT TO RESPOND
TO THAT IN A COUPLE WAYS. FIRST IS LEGISLATIVE INTENT. AND THE COURT HAS
TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS SECTION AS IT WAS WRITTEN. THIS
SECTION WAS WRITTEN BY THE SAME -- BY A LEGISLATURE WHICH HAS FINALLY
BEGAN TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS AND ISSUES OF BATTERED WOMEN. THIS IS
LEGISLATURE THAT WITHIN THE FAMILY CODE HAS THE FAMILY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
PREVENTION ACT. PASSED 273.6 PENAL CODE REGARDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
RESTRAINING ORDER, HELPED EXPAND, BROADEN 273.5, DOMESTIC ASSAULT
LEGISLATION. AND IN THE SAME YEAR, THEY BROADENED 1107, PASSED
MODIFICATIONS TO 12022 REGARDING SEIZING WEAPONS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
CODE AND JUST LAST YEAR PASSED BATTERED WOMAN'S ACT WHICH PROVIDED
ALMOST 30 MILLION DOLLARS -- I THINK IT WAS 28 MILLION DOLLARS
SPECIFICALLY FOR PROVIDING FOR THE PROSECUTION AND PROTECTION OF
BATTERED WOMEN. THAT'S A PUBLIC POLICY VOICED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. THESE
ARE SOME OF THE SECTIONS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. AND WHAT HAPPENED
IN 1107 IS, 1107 AROSE AT A TIME WHEN COURTS WERE NOT ALLOWING EVIDENCE
IN IN CASES WHERE A WOMAN HAD KILLED HER BATTERER AND COURTS WERE NOT
ALLOWING IN CERTAIN EVIDENCE. SUFAT (PHONETIC) WAS ONE, CASE THAT
OCCURRED -- CULVER CITY CASE ACTUALLY. 1107 CAME AS A RESPONSE. AND WHEN
1107 FIRST CAME IN IN THE LANGUAGE WE SEE IT, OPPOSITION AROSE FROM
BATTERED WOMEN'S GROUPS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BY PROSECUTORS, BY WOMEN'S
GROUPS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SAYING, "HOLD ON. WE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU
ARE DOING IN THE INTEREST OF BATTERED WOMEN," WHICH THAT IS BY FAR, THE
PURPOSE OF THAT SECTION IS TO ASSIST BATTERED WOMEN. "WE UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU ARE DOING, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HURT US BECAUSE IF YOU PASS THE
SECTION, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME UP AND MAKE ARGUMENTS JUST LIKE THE
ONES THE DEFENSE ARE MAKING HERE. AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE A SECTION
WHICH PRESCRIBES US THAT WAY AND LIMITS US. DON'T LIMIT US. IF ANYTHING,
EXPAND IT." AND THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMAN EAVES RESPONDED TO THAT AND
AMENDMENTS WERE DRAWN UP AND MADE TO 1107 TO SPECIFICALLY INDICATE WHAT
THE PRESCRIPTION WAS IN 1107. AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE ANALYSIS OF THAT
BILL, AB785 THAT WAS DONE IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- AND I
THINK I GAVE THE COURT SPECIFIC QUOTES OF THAT IN MY RESPONSE BRIEF --
IN THAT AREA WHICH DEALT WITH PRESCRIPTION, THE COURT -- THE LEGISLATURE
SPECIFICALLY, SPECIFICALLY DEALT WITH BLEDSOE AND BOWKER AND SAID, "THE
SAME PRESCRIPTION THAT WE HAVE HERE IN BLEDSOE AND BOWKER IS THE SAME
PRESCRIPTION THAT WE WANT TO HAVE IN 1107." WE DON'T INTEND TO BLOCK ANY
OTHER CASE LAW, ANY OTHER THEORIES OF ADMISSIBILITY. WE DON'T INTEND TO
BLOCK ANY OTHER CASE LAW. WE WANT TO MIRROR THIS. AND IN FACT, IN 1992,
AFTER THIS ACTION WAS PASSED WITH THAT INTENT AND LANGUAGE, IT WAS
BROADENED EVEN FURTHER TO ALLOW NOT ONLY BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME
EVIDENCE, BUT ALSO SPECIFICALLY THE IMPRESSIONS, NATURE, SENSIBILITIES
OF THE VICTIM OF BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME. SO THERE IS -- BY NO MEANS,
THIS WAS NOT EXCLUSIONARY STATUTE. BY NO MEANS WAS THIS STATUTE MEANT TO
BLOCK OTHER EXISTING CASE LAW OR OTHER THEORIES. AND WHAT IS INTERESTING
-- IS ACTUALLY VERY INTERESTING AND A PARADOX WITHIN BLEDSOE -- AND
BLEDSOE AND BOWKER -- WHEN YOU READ ARIS, WHICH TALKS ABOUT BLEDSOE AND
BOWKER AND HOW THOSE CASES RELATE TO THIS SYNDROME, WHAT IT SAYS IS, YOU
KNOW, THE ONLY REASON THAT THE RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME AND CHILD ABUSE
ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME ARE NOT ALLOWED FOR THE PURPOSES THAT WE ARE
PRESCRIBING -- AND THAT PURPOSE IS A VERY DISCREET ONE. THAT PURPOSE IS
THAT FOR ME TO CALL AN EXPERT IN A CHILD ABUSE CASE AND SAY, "DR. SO AND
SO, HAVE YOU EXAMINED THE VICTIM IN THIS CASE; AND AFTER HAVING DONE SO,
DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER SHE WAS ABUSED OR NOT?" THAT I CAN
NOT DO. ABSOLUTELY. AND DON'T IN THOSE CASES AND WOULDN'T IN THIS CASE.
WHAT I CAN DO, WHAT I ABSOLUTELY CAN DO IS TO BRING IN CIRCUMSTANCES
SURROUNDING WHAT OCCURS AND WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN THIS CHILD'S LIFE, KIND
OF EVIDENCE LIKE ACTING OUT IN SCHOOL, HER SCHOOL RECORDS, HOW --
CHANGES IN HER RELATIONSHIP, CHANGES IN HER BEHAVIOR, EXTERNAL EVIDENCE
BY WHATEVER PURPOSE I CAN BRING IT IN, AND THEN HAVE AN EXPERT TALK
ABOUT VICTIMS OF THAT AGE AND CLASS WITHOUT REFERRING TO THE VICTIM HERE
AT ALL. IN OTHER WORDS, SAY TO THAT EXPERT, "HAVE YOU DONE RESEARCH WITH
REGARDS TO EFFECTS OF THE SEXUAL ABUSE ON EIGHT YEAR OLDS?" "YES, I
HAVE." "WHAT KIND OF BEHAVIORS OCCUR? WHAT HAPPENS?" HAVE THEM SAY
WHATEVER THEY SAY. AND THEN IN CLOSING, IF I CAN MATCH IT UP, GREAT. I
CAN MATCH IT UP. SAME WITH RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME. AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY
KEY IN BOTH OF THOSE WHEN ANY MISCONCEPTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP EITHER
THROUGH CROSS-EXAMINATION, OPENING ARGUMENT, PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE
WITH REGARD TO ANY OF THOSE SYNDROMES. AND THE ONE THAT THE COURT HAS
COMMONLY HEARD -- AND I KNOW THIS HAS OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THIS COURT
BEFORE WITH RAPE CASES -- "WHY DID YOU WAIT TO REPORT THIS TO THE
POLICE? YOU HAD BEEN OUT WITH HIM BEFORE. SO THEREFORE, YOU CAN'T BE
RAPED." THE CHILD, "WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY?" WELL,
LOOK, THIS KID WAS HAVING TROUBLE IN SCHOOL. SO SHE MUST BE A BAD KID IN
LYING. ALL THOSE KIND OF INFERENCES THERE THAT ARE RAISED. WHAT IS
INTERESTING IN BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME, WHAT IS FASCINATING, IT'S KIND
OF PROPHETIC HERE COMPARED TO THOSE CASES, IS THAT THE MISCONCEPTIONS
THAT WE HEAR IN BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME CASES, THE MISCONCEPTIONS THAT
ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THE MOVING PAPERS BY DEFENSE THAT WERE ARGUED IN
FRONT OF THIS COURT YESTERDAY, WERE LAID OUT AND ARGUED IN VERY SPECIFIC
NUMBER AS THOSE MYTHS AROUND BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME IN 1979.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. GORDON, LET'S TAKE OUR RECESS AT THIS POINT.

*MR. GORDON:* COULD WE APPROACH FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?

*THE COURT:* WE'LL RESUME AT 1:30.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD AT THE BENCH.)

(AT 12:05 P.M., THE NOON RECESS WAS TAKEN UNTIL 1:30 P.M. OF THE SAME DAY.)

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, JANUARY 12, 1995 1:33 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. 103 HON. LANCE A. ITO, JUDGE

APPEARANCES: (APPEARANCES AS HERETOFORE NOTED.)

(JANET M. MOXHAM, CSR NO. 4855, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(CHRISTINE M. OLSON, CSR NO. 2378, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

*THE COURT:* GOOD AFTERNOON, COUNSEL. BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON
MATTER. THE DEFENDANT IS AGAIN PRESENT WITH HIS COUNSEL. THE PEOPLE ARE
REPRESENTED.

*MR. GORDON:* GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR.

*THE COURT:* MR. GORDON, YOU WERE GOING TO CONCLUDE YOUR COMMENTS?

*MR. GORDON:* YES, SIR. I AM GOING TO MOVE THEM RIGHT ALONG. I WANT TO
TALK ABOUT ONE CASE, AND YESTERDAY WE HAD TALKED ABOUT PRESENTING SOME
TESTIMONY. I HAVE TALKED TO MR. BAILEY ABOUT IT. WITH THE COURT'S LEAVE
WE WILL BE PRESENTING SOME SHORT TESTIMONY BY DR. DUTTON THAT WOULD
ASSIST THE COURT. THE DEFENSE HAS WITHDRAWN THE OBJECTION.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. PROCEED.

*MR. GORDON:* ONE CASE I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT WITH THE COURT BEFORE
WE TALK TO DR. DUTTON IS A CASE THAT WE HAVE CITED IN OUR BRIEF CALLED
PEOPLE VERSUS PHILLIPS AT 122 CAL.APP.3D 69. I JUST MENTION PHILLIPS FOR
A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE, I THINK IT IS THE USE THAT THE COURT USED
EXPERT TESTIMONY FOR IN PHILLIPS WHICH WAS APPROVED OF IN SEVERAL
SUPREME COURT CASES, INCLUDING STOLL. I THINK IS VERY ANALOGOUS TO A
SITUATION WE MAY HAVE OCCUR IN THIS CASE. PHILLIPS WAS A CASE OF
HOMICIDE IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT KILLED HER CHILDREN THROUGH A SYNDROME
KNOWN AS MUNCHAUSEN BY PROXY SYNDROME AND IN THAT SYNDROME -- I'M SURE
THE COURT IS AWARE OF IT -- THIS WAS A WOMAN THAT DESCRIBED TO THE
WORLD, BY ALL PUBLIC ACCOUNTS, WAS THIS WELL-TO-DO MOTHER, EVERYTHING
WAS FINE, SHE HAD THIS GRAND LIFE, TWO KIDS, THE STATION WAGON IN THE
DRIVEWAY, EVERYTHING LOOKED WONDERFUL, AND YET THIS HORRID ACT OF HER
KILLING HER KID -- HER KIDS THROUGH THIS SYNDROME OCCURRED. THE
PROSECUTION ASKED THE COURT TO USE EXPERT TESTIMONY, NOT TO DIAGNOSE
THIS WOMAN, NOT TO SAY THAT THEY HAD READ THE RECORD AND HAD LOOKED AT
THE HISTORY HERE -- AND THIS WAS CLEARLY A MUNCHAUSEN BY PROXY CASE --
NOT TO IN ANY WAY EXAMINE THE RECORD, BUT TO GET UP AND JUST DESCRIBE
WHAT OCCURRED WITHIN THAT SYNDROME IN GENERAL, TO EXPLAIN IT TO THE JURY
SO THAT THEY COULD UNDERSTAND, IF PROVEN, IF THE FACTS UNDERNEATH
PROVEN, SHOW A MOTIVE, THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DOES EXIST AND IT IN
FACT PROVIDES A MOTIVE. AND IN FACT THERE IS A QUOTE THAT WITHIN
PHILLIPS THAT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AND IT APPEARS AROUND PAGE 77 TO
80, WHERE IN THAT PASSAGE AT 77 TO 80 THE PHILLIPS COURT SPECIFICALLY
LAYS OUT A PROCEDURE FOR -- FOR PRESENTATION OF THIS KIND OF TESTIMONY,
INCLUDING HOW THE QUESTION SHOULD BE FRAMED, WHAT ISSUES CAN IT GO TO
AND A JURY INSTRUCTION, 2.72 THAT SHOULD BE READ WITH THE TESTIMONY AS
IT -- RIGHT AFTER IT COMES IN IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, AND THERE THE
COURT SAID:

"WHILE PROSECUTOR ORDINARILY NEED NOT PROVE MOTIVE AS AN ELEMENT OF A
CRIME, THE ABSENCE OF APPARENT MOTIVE MAY MAKE PROOF OF THE ESSENTIAL
ELEMENTS LESS PERSUASIVE. CLEARLY THAT WAS THE PRINCIPLE PROBLEM
CONFRONTING THE PROSECUTOR HERE. IN THE ABSENCE OF A MOTIVATIONAL
HYPOTHESIS AND IN LIGHT OF OTHER INFORMATION WHICH THE JURY HAD
CONCERNING HER PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER, THE CONDUCT OF THE APPELLANT
WAS APPARENTLY INEXPLICABLE, AS BOTH PARTIES RECOGNIZED THE EXPERT'S
TESTIMONY WAS DESIGNED TO FILL THIS GAP." SO PHILLIPS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE
OF OUTSIDE OF ONE OF THESE USES WHERE EXPERT TESTIMONY WAS USED IN A
CASE IN CHIEF TO EXPLAIN A MOTIVE, NOT TO DIAGNOSE THE VICTIM, NOT TO
DIAGNOSE THE DEFENDANT, NOT TO ANALYZE EVIDENCE, BUT TO PRESENT
INFORMATION TO THE TRIER OF FACTS SO THAT IT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD. AND IN
DAY, A CASE THAT SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT A WOMAN'S ISSUES, THERE IS --
DAY HAS A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT QUOTE WHICH THE COURT SHOULD CONSIDER
WITH REGARD TO 352 TYPE OF INFORMATION OR ANALYSIS FOR THIS TESTIMONY.
AND IN DAY, WHICH WAS TESTIMONY REGARDING THE KIND OF ISSUES WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT HERE, WHERE THERE WAS A 352 OBJECTION TO THE EXPERT
TESTIMONY, THE DAY COURT SAID, LOOK, THIS ISN'T ANY KIND OF MAGIC THAT
IS BEING PLACED IN FRONT OF SOME GULLIBLE GROUP OF PEOPLE; THIS IS
REASONABLE INFORMATION BEING PLACED IN FRONT OF A REASONABLE TRIER OF
FACT AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY PROPER. AND NOT ONLY IS THAT SUPPORTED BY THE
LAW, THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES WHICH WE HAVE CITED IN OUR BRIEF, LAW
REVIEW ARTICLES AND STUDIES WHICH HAVE IN FACT -- AND I DON'T KNOW HOW
MANY TIMES THE COURT GETS THIS KIND OF INFORMATION-- HAS IN FACT
MEASURED THE IMPACT OF EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY ON THE TRIAL PROCESS AND
JURIES WITH REGARD TO BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME.

THOSE ARE CITED IN OUR BRIEF, AND AS THE COURT SAW ON THE BRIEF, WHAT
WAS INDICATED IS THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH PREJUDICIAL IMPACT AS DESCRIBED
BY MR. UELMEN YESTERDAY AT ALL. IN FACT, WHAT THE STUDIES FOUND AND WHAT
THE COURTS FOUND IN DAY AND ARIS AND IN THE OTHER CASES, IS THAT, AS I
HAVE SAID BEFORE, TO MAKE A DECISION WITHOUT THIS COULD CONSTITUTE GRAVE
INJUSTICE. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL DR. DUTTON IF I COULD, SIR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

DONALD DUTTON, CALLED AS A WITNESS BY THE PEOPLE, WAS SWORN AND
TESTIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

*THE CLERK:* PLEASE RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND TO BE SWORN. DO YOU SOLEMNLY
SWEAR THAT THE TESTIMONY YOU MAY GIVE IN THE CAUSE NOW PENDING BEFORE
THIS COURT, SHALL BE THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE
TRUTH, SO HELP YOU GOD.

*THE WITNESS:* I DO.

*THE CLERK:* PLEASE BE SEATED AND STATE AND SPELL YOUR FIRST AND LAST
NAMES FOR THE RECORD.

*THE WITNESS:* DONALD DUTTON, D-U-T-T-O-N.

*MR. GORDON:* YOUR HONOR, I HAVE PRESENTED THE COURT WITH A COPY OF
PROFESSOR DUTTON'S CURRICULUM VITAE YESTERDAY. IF THE COURT DOESN'T HAVE
ONE HANDY, I HAVE ANOTHER ONE.

*THE COURT:* I HAVE IT HERE IN MY HAND.

*MR. GORDON:* I HAVE TALKED TO THE DEFENSE, AND FOR PURPOSES OF THIS
HEARING ONLY AND LIMITED ONLY FOR THESE PURPOSES, THEY MIGHT OFFER TO
STIPULATE AS TO THE MATERIAL STATED FORTH IN THE CURRICULUM VITAE AND
THAT DR. DUTTON WOULD QUALIFY AS AN EXPERT WITH REGARD TO DYNAMICS OF
SPOUSAL ASSAULT.

*MR. BAILEY:* THAT'S CORRECT, YOUR HONOR. WE RECOGNIZE HIM AS
WELL-RESPECTED IN HIS FIELD.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU. I WILL ACCEPT THE STIPULATION.

*MR. GORDON:* THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* MR. GORDON.

*MR. GORDON:* THANK YOU.

DIRECT EXAMINATION

BY MR. GORDON:

*Q:* DOCTOR, IN YOUR WORK HAVE YOU DONE ANY STUDIES OR BEEN FAMILIAR
WITH A SYNDROME KNOWN AS THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME?

*A:* YES, I HAVE.

*Q:* DOES THAT SYNDROME IN ITSELF GO TOWARD THE DESCRIPTION OF ANY
CERTAIN AFFECTS OR ANY ONE PARTICULAR DYNAMIC OF SPOUSAL ASSAULT?

*A:* WELL, IT IS TYPICALLY USED TO DESCRIBE REACTIONS THAT BATTERED
WOMEN HAVE, BUT THERE IS ALSO SOME MATERIAL IN THE LITERATURE THAT
DESCRIBES THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT WHAT'S CALLED
BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME.

*Q:* NOW, BEYOND BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME, HAVE YOU DONE ANY WORK OR
DONE ANY RESEARCH IN ANY AREA OR DYNAMIC OF SPOUSAL ASSAULT OTHER THAN
BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME?

*A:* YES. MOST OF THE WORK I DO IS ON PROFILING PERPETRATORS OF INTIMATE
ABUSE.

*Q:* BATTERERS?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "PROFILING"?

*A:* I MEAN WHAT WE DO IN OUR RESEARCH IS TO DO PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES
OF MEN WHO ARE COURT-MANDATED FOR TREATMENT FOR WIFE ASSAULT AND SOME
MEN WHO COME IN WHO ARE SELF-REFERRED, AND THEN TO COMPARE THOSE
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE TO THEIR WIFE'S REPORTS OF THE MAN'S ABUSIVENESS,
PHYSICAL ABUSE, EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND OTHER FORMS OF ABUSE. WE TRY TO
MATCH THE TWO UP, IN OTHER WORDS, TO SEE HOW THE WHOLE PROFILE STANDS.

*Q:* YOU HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO PROFILE WORK WITH CERTAIN
BATTERINGS OR BATTERED POPULATIONS?

*A:* YES, I HAVE.

*Q:* APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY?

*A:* MEN OR POPULATIONS?

*Q:* FIRST MEN?

*A:* OKAY. WELL, APPROXIMATELY 700 MEN. WE HAVE RESEARCHED DATA ON ABOUT
300 TO 400 MEN.

*Q:* AND WHEN YOU SAY "POPULATIONS," HAVE YOU LOOKED AT OR RESEARCHED
ANY SPECIFIC POPULATIONS IN ADDITION TO THAT?

*A:* YES, WE HAVE.

*Q:* AND WHAT IS THAT, SIR?

*A:* VARIETY OF ETHNIC POPULATIONS AND PRIMARILY A VARIETY OF ETHNIC
POPULATIONS AND DIFFERENT SOCIOECONOMIC POPULATIONS.

*Q:* AND WHERE HAS THIS WORK OCCURRED?

*A:* IN VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLOMBIA.

*Q:* ANTICIPATED THAT THAT MAY COME UP. HAVE YOU DONE ANY RESEARCH OR
ANY WORK COMPARING OR LOOKING AT THE FACT WHERE THIS WORK IS DONE
COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

*A:* OH, YEAH. SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH IS REALLY AN INTERNATIONAL
ENTERPRISE AND I AM IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH MY U.S. COLLEAGUES AND WE
ARE COMPARING PAPERS BACK AND FORTH ALL THE TIME. THERE DOESN'T REALLY
SEEM TO BE MUCH EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS ANY PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN
THE DETERMINANTS OF INTIMATES ABUSIVE NEGLIGENCE BETWEEN CANADA AND
U.S., FOR EXAMPLE. SOCIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BUT NOT PSYCHOLOGICAL
DIFFERENCES.

*Q:* ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH A SOCIAL SCIENCE ARGUMENT THAT HAS BEEN PUT
FORTH IN THE DEFENSE BRIEF, ESSENTIALLY TO SUMMARIZE IT, THAT BECAUSE
THERE IS 2.5 MILLION BATTERINGS A YEAR AND, SAY, ONLY ONE TO 2000
DOMESTIC HOMICIDES OR SPOUSAL HOMICIDES, THAT THERE IS NO LINK BETWEEN
THOSE TWO?

*A:* YES, I AM.

*Q:* DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION OF THAT, SIR?

*A:* YES, I DO.

*Q:* AND WHAT IS IT?

*A:* WELL, COULD I DEMONSTRATE IT? I THINK I CAN MAYBE JUST SORT OF SHOW
IT VERY QUICKLY HERE.

*Q:* I HAVE --

*A:* JUST TO DEMONSTRATE IT VERY QUICKLY TO THE COURT.

*MR. GORDON:* WE HAVE SEVERAL CHARTS.

*THE WITNESS:* OKAY. I JUST NEED THE ONE FIRST.

*MR. GORDON:* SIX CHARTS MARKED AS PEOPLE'S 1?

*THE WITNESS:* CAN YOU SEE THAT?

*MR. BAILEY:* CAN WE TURN IT SLIGHTLY, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* SURE.

*MR. GORDON:* MARKED FOR I.D. NEXT ORDER.

*THE WITNESS:* THIS IS SOMETHING CALLED THE "CONFLICTS TACTICS" SCALE, A
SCALE THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY DR. MURRAY STRAUSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW
HAMPSHIRE. THIS IS A SCALE THAT HAS BEEN USED IN ALL OF THE U.S.
NATIONAL SURVEYS OF INCIDENTS OF SPOUSAL ASSAULT. HE DID A NATIONAL
SURVEY IN 1975, HE DID ANOTHER ONE IN 1985, HE DID A THIRD ONE IN 1992.
NOW, TO BE CONSIDERED ASSAULTIVE, ALL THAT HAS TO HAPPEN, AND I'M NOT
TRYING TO MINIMIZE THIS, IS THAT A MAN HAS TO OR -- THE SURVEYS ARE DONE
BOTH WITH PERPETRATORS AND VICTIMS. THE RESULTS MAY BE SURPRISINGLY
ABOUT THE SAME. THERE IS NOT A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN INCIDENCE RATE WHETHER
YOU ASKED THE QUESTION "DID YOU DO THIS" OR WHETHER YOU ASK THE QUESTION
"WAS THIS EVER DONE TO YOU," BUT IF SOMEONE ANSWERS "YES" TO ANY ONE OF
THESE QUESTIONS: "PUSHED, GRABBED OR SHOVED THE OTHER ONE, SLAPPED
ANOTHER ONE, KICKED, BIT OR HIT THE OTHER ONE, HIT OR TRIED TO HIT WITH
SOMETHING, BEAT UP, THREATENED WITH A KNIFE OR GUN OR USED A KNIFE OR
GUN," THEY JUST HAVE TO ANSWER YES TO ANY ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS TO GO
INTO THIS GENERAL POOL OF MEN WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ASSAULTIVE.

*Q:* AND WHY IS THAT SIGNIFICANT FOR THIS OPINION THAT WAS RENDERED?

*A:* UMM, WELL, IT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT IS A RATHER LIBERAL
CRITERION, I THINK, GIVEN THE KIND OF EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT IN THIS CASE. AS THE NUMBER OF ACTS BECOMES MORE SERIOUS AND MORE
FREQUENT, THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU GET INTO A DIFFERENT KIND OF
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE PERSON WHO WAS COMMITTING THOSE ACTS. I MEAN, JUST TO
GIVE A CASE IN POINT, IF A MAN ONCE IN HIS MARRIAGE, IN REACTION TO
SITUATIONAL STRESSES, HAPPENS TO PUSH HIS WIFE, HE STILL QUALIFIES FOR
THIS LARGE POOL OF MEN WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO BE BATTERERS, BUT I WOULD
SAY AS A PSYCHOLOGIST THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT MAN THAN SOMEONE WHO IS
USING THESE MORE SERIOUS TYPES OF PHYSICAL ASSAULTS AND IS USING THEM
REPEATEDLY. AND WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE MEN USING THE "BEAT UP" AND THE
MORE SERIOUS TYPES OF ASSAULT REPEATEDLY, THEN YOU ARE DOWN TO TWO
PERCENT OF THE U.S. POPULATION.

*Q:* AND IS THAT THE ONLY SCALE YOU WOULD LIMIT YOUR ANALYSIS TO?

*A:* DEFINITELY NOT. THIS JUST MEASURES PRIMARILY PHYSICAL ACTIONS.
PROBABLY AS IMPORTANT A SCALE IS ONE THAT WAS ALLUDED TO IN COURT
PREVIOUSLY. IT IS DEVELOPED BY DR. RICHARD TOLMAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN, SOMETIMES CALLED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MALTREATMENT OF WOMEN
INVENTORY, BUT WE WILL CALL IT THE TOLMAN SCALE, AFTER THE FOUNDER. THIS
SCALE MEASURES A VARIETY OF EMOTIONAL ABUSE ITEMS, PUT DOWN BY PHYSICAL
APPEARANCE, INSULTED ME OR SHAMED ME, CALLED ME NAMES, SWORE AT ME. THIS
IS ONE CATEGORY OF THE TOLMAN SCALE THAT DEALS SPECIFICALLY WITH
EMOTIONAL ABUSE, THAT IS ATTEMPTS TO UNDERMINE THE SELF-ESTEEM OF THE
OTHER PERSON.

*Q:* HOW DOES THAT RELATE -- DOES THAT NARROW THE POPULATION YOU LOOK AT
WITH THE OTHER --

*A:* IT NARROWS IT CONSIDERABLY, AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECOND
FACTOR ON THIS SCALE, WHICH IS CALLED DOMINANCE ISOLATION, WHERE THE ONE
PERSON IS TRYING TO TOTALLY CONTROL THE OTHER PERSON'S USE OF SPACE OR
TIME, MONITORED MY TIME AND MADE ME ACCOUNT FOR IT, ORDERED ME AROUND,
WAS STINGY IN GIVING ME MONEY, THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS TIE INTO THIS
SECOND FACTOR ON THIS SCALE, WHICH IS THE DOMINANCE ISOLATION SCALE.
NOW, IF YOU GET SOMEONE WHO AGAIN IS FREQUENTLY USING A LOT OF THESE
ITEMS ON THIS EMOTIONALLY ABUSED SCALE, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PHYSICAL
ABUSE, THEN YOU'VE GOT A MUCH SMALLER GROUP OF MEN WITH A MUCH HIGHER
RISK FACTOR, BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMES OUT OF THIS SCALE IS A
VERY STRONG MOTIVE FOR CONTROL OF THE OTHER PERSON, CONTROL AND
DOMINATION OF THE OTHER PERSON.

*Q:* AND WOULD YOU LIMIT IT THERE? SO THIS HAS REDUCED THE POPULATION
GREATLY, CORRECT?

*A:* THIS HAS REDUCED IT GREATLY AND ACTUALLY THIS SCALE GOES RIGHT
THROUGH TO AND INCLUDING "THREATS" DOWN TOWARD THE END, SO YES, THAT
LIMITS IT VERY GREATLY AND WOULD INCREASE THE RISK FACTOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THOSE THREE CHART PAGES WILL BE PEOPLE'S 9.

(PEO'S 9 FOR ID = 3 CHARTS)

*MR. GORDON:* THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE MORE.

*THE WITNESS:* OKAY.

*Q:* BY MR. GORDON: IS THAT THE ONLY SCALE YOU WOULD LIMIT IT TO?

*A:* NO, THAT IS NOT THE ONLY SCALE WE WOULD LIMIT IT TO, BUT AS YOU
INCREASE DATA -- SEE, WHAT I'M SAYING IS THIS HUGE POOL OF MEN WHO ARE
CALLED ASSAULTIVE WERE BASED SIMPLY ON MEN WHO ANSWERED "YES" TO ONE
QUESTION ON THAT FIRST SCALE. OUR RESEARCH SHOWS YOU CAN GO WAY BEYOND
IT AND AS YOU GO WAY BEYOND IT YOU GET TO A PSYCHOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT
GROUP OF MEN WHO ARE USING CONTROL AND DOMINATION AS A PRIMARY MOTIVE IN
THEIR RELATIONSHIPS AND THESE ARE MEN WHO I WOULD CALL ABUSIVE
PERSONALITIES BUT THEY ARE PSYCHOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERYBODY IN
THAT BROADER CATEGORY.

*Q:* TAKE YOUR SEAT AGAIN.

*A:* (WITNESS COMPLIES.)

*Q:* WHY -- WELL, WHEN THE FIRST -- THE STATISTIC THAT CAME OUT THE 2.5
MILLION WAS TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT
CASE OF SPOUSAL ABUSE OR WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS ABUSIVE PERSONALITY, DO
YOU LIMIT YOUR INQUIRY ONLY TO PHYSICAL ACTS?

*A:* ABSOLUTELY NOT. WE LOOK AT THE BROADER PICTURE OF EMOTIONAL ABUSE
DOMINANCE ISOLATION. WE LOOK AT INTRUSIVENESS, IF THE COUPLE HAS
SEPARATED. WE LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED STALKING BEHAVIOR AND WE ALSO
LOOK AT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.

*Q:* THESE OTHER BEHAVIORS THAT YOU HAVE JUST DESCRIBED, THE EMOTIONAL
ABUSE, VERBAL ABUSE, HUMILIATION, STALKING, PHYSICAL ABUSE, DO YOU EVER
LOOK AT FINANCIAL ABUSE OR FINANCIAL --

*A:* WE CONSIDER FINANCIAL ABUSE TO BE PART OF THE DOMINATION CONTROL
SUBSECTION ON THIS SCALE. IT IS ONE ASPECT OF IT.

*Q:* DO THEY HAVE ANY CONTACT OR CONNECTION OR LINK IN ANY WAY TO
BATTERING OR PHYSICAL ABUSE?

*A:* YES, THEY ARE ALL HIGHLY STATISTICALLY CORRELATED. THEY ARE
SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO EACH OTHER.

*Q:* DO THEY SHARE ANY COMMON CHARACTERISTICS, THOSE TYPES OF ABUSE?

*A:* WELL, THE MAIN COMMON CHARACTERISTIC IS THAT THEY ALL HAVE AN
UNDERLYING MOTIVE OF CONTROL OF THE OTHER PERSON.

*Q:* DO THEY ALL HAVE -- FAIR TO SAY THEY ARE ALL WITHIN THE SAME
DESIGN, WHICH IS IN CONTROL?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* AND IN YOUR OPINION, IN TRYING TO FIND A LINK BETWEEN THE HOMICIDE
AND THE BATTERING POPULATION, IS IT PROPER TO LOOK AT THIS BROADER 2.5
MILLION SUBSET OR SET?

*A:* NO, NOT REALLY. I MEAN, YOU ARE COMPARING, IN MY OPINION,
FENDER-BENDERS WITH HEAD-ON COLLISIONS IF YOU DO IT THAT WAY.

*Q:* AND IN YOUR OPINION, IF YOU HAVE THE MULTIPLE TYPES OF ABUSE WITHIN
A HISTORY, WITHIN A PERSONALITY, THAT POPULATION, THERE IS A LINK
BETWEEN THAT AND SPOUSAL HOMICIDES?

*A:* THERE IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL LINK. THERE HAS -- IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT
IT EMPIRICALLY, YOU ARE LOOKING AT A WHOLE SEPARATE SET OF STUDIES AND
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE STUDIES WHICH ARE ALLUDED TO IN COURT THE OTHER
DAY, WHICH ARE STUDIES THAT ARE DONE ON WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED BY
INTIMATE PARTNERS AND WHERE THE RESEARCHERS HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO
INVESTIGATE THAT STUDY. THAT IS, THEY START WITH THE CORONER'S REPORT,
WORKED BACK TO THE POLICE REPORT, AND IN SOME CASES GONE BACK AND
INTERVIEWED THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THE VICTIM TO FIND OUT AS MUCH AS
THEY COULD ABOUT WHAT THE BACKGROUND FACTORS WERE IN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.

*Q:* NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THESE HISTORIES, IS IT SIGNIFICANT TO
YOU TO LOOK AT INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED WITHIN THE PAST YEAR?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* HOW ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* WHY?

*A:* UMM, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING THAT
HAPPENED TEN YEARS IN THE PAST IS HISTORY AND UNRELATED, IN FACT WHAT
FREQUENTLY GOES ON IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS IS VERY DIFFERENT. LET ME
JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE IF I MIGHT. I HAD A MALE CLIENT WHO BEAT
UP HIS WIFE IN 1985. WHEN HE BEAT HER UP HE SAID, "NEXT TIME IT IS GOING
TO BE WORSE" AND SHE REPORTED TO ME THAT WHEN HE BEAT HER UP HIS FACE
CHANGED, HIS PHYSIOGNOMY CHANGED, HIS NOSTRILS FLARED, HE HAD A VERY
DIFFERENT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE. FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS HE NEVER HIT
HER AGAIN, BUT WHENEVER SHE SAW THAT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE, SHE
IMMEDIATELY TOWED THE LINE, SO THERE WAS A CONTINUING CONTROL THAT WENT
ON EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A SEVEN-YEAR GAP BETWEEN THAT 1985 INCIDENCE OF
PHYSICAL ABUSE AND THE NEXT INCIDENCE OF PHYSICAL ABUSE.

*Q:* WAS IT SIGNIFICANT TO YOU TO CONSIDER BOTH OF THOSE ACTS?

*A:* THEY HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION. IF THE TWO -- IF THE
INTERACTION OF THE CONTROL DOMINATION EMOTIONAL ABUSE IS NOT CONSIDERED
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PHYSICAL ABUSE, YOU LOSE THE CONTEXT OF THE
PHYSICAL ABUSE, YOU LOSE THE MEANING AND MOTIVATION OF PHYSICAL ABUSE.

*Q:* IN REGARD TO THE STUDIES OF SPOUSAL HOMICIDE, IS THERE ANY ONE
MOTIVE THAT HAS COME OUT AS PREDOMINANT?

*A:* WELL, THE MAIN PRECIPITATING FACTOR -- IN FACT, THERE IS SIX
DIFFERENT STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE. THE FIRST ONE WAS MARTIN
WOLFGANG, DID A STUDY IN PHILADELPHIA, WHICH IS STILL A CLASSIC IN 1948,
BUT THE TWO MAIN THINGS THAT COME OUT IS, FIRST OF ALL, ESTRANGEMENT,
JEALOUSY, A HISTORY OF PHYSICAL ABUSE AND/OR JEALOUSY IN THE
RELATIONSHIP AND RECENT ESTRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE PERPETRATOR AND VICTIM.

*Q:* WHEN YOU SAY "ESTRANGEMENT," DOES THAT MEAN DIVORCE?

*A:* IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN DIVORCE. "ESTRANGEMENT" IS REALLY SORT
OF A SUBJECTIVE TERM. IT MEANS THAT THE PERPETRATOR IN HIS MIND -- AND
I'M TALKING HERE ABOUT WOMEN BEING KILLED BY MEN, SO I USE THE TERM
"HIS" -- IN HIS MIND THE PERPETRATOR HAS SEEN THE RELATIONSHIP AS
FINALLY LOST. THAT TOTALLY CHANGES HIS PSYCHOLOGY AT THAT POINT, SO IT
GOES FROM CONTROL AND DENIGRATE TO DESTROY AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE
PSYCHIATRIC LITERATURE ON THAT AND SOME OF THIS LITERATURE WE HAVE USED
IN OUR OWN RESEARCH.

*Q:* SO THE MERE FACT THAT THERE IS A DIVORCE MIGHT NOT TRIGGER THAT?

*A:* NOT NECESSARILY IF THEY ARE DIVORCED, BUT THE MAN STILL IS HOLDING
OUT SOME KIND OF HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT RECONCILE, THEN HE HAS STILL
BONDED HER AND HE MIGHT NOT SUBJECTIVELY SEE THEM AS BEING ESTRANGED AT
THIS POINT.

*Q:* SO HE MIGHT GO ON WITH THIS CONTROL NOTION UNTIL SOME OTHER EVENT
TRIGGERS THIS EVENT?

*A:* THAT IS --

*Q:* WOULD IT HAVE TO BE SOME MAJOR EVENT, LIKE MOVING OUT OF STATE?

*A:* IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A MAJOR EVENT. IT COULD BE A MINOR EVENT,
DEPENDING ON HOW THAT MAN CONSTRUES THE EVENTS AND WHAT ITS SYMBOLIC
VALUE IS TO HIM.

*Q:* WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

*A:* WELL, I MEAN, UMM, IF -- LET'S SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, A WOMAN HAS ALWAYS
ANSWERED HIS PHONE CALLS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN DIVORCED, OKAY, AND
SUDDENLY SHE STOPS ANSWERING HIS CALLS AND STOPS RETURNING HIS CALLS,
REPEATEDLY OVER TIME, EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A TRIVIAL THING,
MORE OR LESS, IN THE OVERALL SCHEME OF THINGS, TO HIM THAT MIGHT HAVE
MAJOR SYMBOLIC SIGNIFICANCE, TO TELL HIM THAT POSSIBLY THIS RELATIONSHIP
NOW IS LOST, OKAY?

*Q:* AND IN SUCH A CASE WHERE YOU WERE TO LOOK AT A HOMICIDE WHERE THIS
ESTRANGEMENT OR MORBID JEALOUSY, AS YOU CALL IT, MIGHT BE THE MOTIVE,
ARE CONTROL HISTORIES IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT?

*A:* CONTROL HISTORIES ARE IMPORTANT AND ONE OF THE STUDIES THAT WAS
DONE, AGAIN THEY FOUND NINETY PERCENT OF THE CASES HAD SOME BACKGROUND
OF CONTROL AND ABUSE THAT PRECEDED THE HOMICIDE.

*Q:* AND WHEN YOU SAY "CONTROL HISTORIES," AGAIN DO YOU LIMIT THAT JUST
TO PHYSICAL ATTACKS?

*A:* NO.

*Q:* DO YOU LOOK AT ALL THE DYNAMICS AND CONTROL MECHANISMS?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* AND THEY ARE LINKED?

*A:* THEY ARE LINKED DEFINITELY.

*MR. GORDON:* MAY I HAVE JUST ONE MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. GORDON:* NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME, SIR.

*THE COURT:* MR. BAILEY.

CROSS-EXAMINATION

BY MR. BAILEY:

*Q:* DR. DUTTON, WHEN WERE YOU FIRST ENGAGED IN THIS CASE BY THE STATE?

*MR. GORDON:* OBJECTION, RELEVANCE, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* OVERRULED. YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION.

*THE WITNESS:* DECEMBER, 1994.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: ALL RIGHT. AND YOU HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE DURING THE
DAY AND A HALF OF HEARINGS THAT HAVE PRECEDED YOUR ARRIVAL ON THE
WITNESS STAND, HAVE YOU NOT?

*A:* YES, I HAVE.

*Q:* AND YOU HAVE LISTENED TO A SERIES OF ALLEGED INCIDENTS PORTRAYED BY
THE PROSECUTION?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* HAVE YOU STUDIED ANY ADDITIONAL MATERIALS RELEVANT TO THE CASE
BEFORE COMING HERE TODAY?

*A:* YES. I LOOKED AT AN EVIDENCE BOOK THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. IS THAT CALLED THE MURDER BOOK, DO YOU KNOW?

*A:* I HADN'T HEARD THAT TERM USED, BUT --

*Q:* SOME BOOK WITH EVIDENCE IN IT?

*A:* YEAH. A GREEN BOOK WITH EVIDENCE IN IT; THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* HAVE YOU LOOKED AT ANYTHING OTHER THAN DOCUMENTS?

*MR. GORDON:* OBJECT ON RELEVANCE GROUNDS.

*THE COURT:* OVERRULED.

*THE WITNESS:* UMM, I HAVE LOOKED AT THE DEFENSE AND PROSECUTION BRIEFS.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: TO JUDGE ITO ON THIS ISSUE?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* ON THIS ISSUE?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* THEN YOU HAVE NOTICED OF COURSE THAT WITHIN THE PAGES OF THE
PROSECUTION'S BRIEF IS THE DULUTH, MINNESOTA, POWER AND CONTROL WHEEL?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* IS THAT SOMETHING TO WHICH YOU MAKE REFERENCE IN YOUR PRACTICE?

*A:* YEAH, WE MAKE -- WE DO MAKE REFERENCE TO IT IN OUR PRACTICE, YES.

*Q:* YOU HAVE SAID THAT SYNDROMES OF THIS TYPE INVOLVE ALL ASPECTS OF
ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL THE VICTIM BY THE BATTERER, TRUE?

*A:* YES, YES.

*Q:* OKAY. ARE YOU AFFILIATED WITH OR FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICAN
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION?

*A:* YES, I AM.

*Q:* DO YOU ATTEND THEIR MEETINGS?

*A:* I AM A MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT, FINE. YOU ARE AWARE OF THE REQUIREMENT IN THE AMERICAN
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION THAT FOR A PSYCHOLOGIST TO GIVE AN OPINION
RELATING TO AN INDIVIDUAL, A PERSONAL EXAMINATION IS NECESSARY?

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* TRUE?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* HAVE YOU EVER EXAMINED MR. SIMPSON?

*A:* NO, I HAVE NOT.

*Q:* HAVE YOU EVER ASKED THE DEFENSE IF THEY HAD ANY COUNTERVAILING
EVIDENCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PROFFER YOU HAVE HEARD THAT WOULD TEND TO
CAST DOUBT UPON THE INCIDENTS ALLEGED?

*A:* NO, I HAVE NOT.

*Q:* OKAY. DID ANYBODY GIVE YOU THE GRAND JURY TESTIMONY OF A MAN NAMED
KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH?

*A:* I HAVE READ THAT.

*Q:* YOU HAVE READ IT?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* OKAY. IF MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN SENT TO YOU IN THE ORDINARY COARSE OF
YOUR PRACTICE --

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* -- THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN AS A RESULT OF THE ORDER OF A
JUDGE OR BECAUSE HE FELT HE HAD A PROBLEM AND WANTED YOUR HELP?

*A:* THAT'S CORRECT.

*MR. GORDON:* CALLS FOR SPECULATION AND IS IRRELEVANT, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* OVERRULED.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: HAVE YOU FREQUENTLY BEEN CALLED UPON TO GIVE OPINION
IN CASES WHERE YOU'VE HAD NO CONTACT WITH EITHER OF THE SUBJECTS?

*A:* I WOULDN'T SAY FREQUENTLY. I HAVE OCCASIONALLY BEEN.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT.

*A:* YES.

*Q:* WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE A BATTERER IT IS NECESSARY TO
HAVE A BATTERED WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* OKAY. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY INSTANCE WHERE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, THE
DECEDENT, WAS EVER DESCRIBED AS OR DIAGNOSED AS A BATTERED WOMAN?

*A:* DIAGNOSED, NO.

*Q:* DID SHE EVER GET ANY TREATMENT THAT YOU KNOW OF?

*A:* NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

*MR. GORDON:* OBJECT, YOUR HONOR. THIS GOES BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS
HEARING AND IT GOES BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE TESTIMONY THAT HAS BEEN
PRESENTED.

*THE COURT:* WE ARE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF HIS EXPERT TESTIMONY IN A
GENERAL SENSE. YOU ARE GOING INTO SPECIFICS REGARDING THIS CASE. DO YOU
REALLY WANT TO GET INTO THAT?

*MR. BAILEY:* MAY I SUGGEST THIS, YOUR HONOR? I GATHER THAT WHAT THE
PROSECUTION IS INVITING THE COURT TO DO IS TO SAY THAT EVEN IF
INADMISSIBLE ON OTHER GROUNDS AS PART OF A SYNDROME, THESE ACTS SHOULD
BE KNITTED TOGETHER AND THEREFORE COME IN. IF I AM MISTAKEN, I'M SURE I
WILL BE CORRECTED, BUT I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT COUNSEL IS
ABOUT. IN ORDER TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD WANT TO MAKE SUCH A
RULING AND THE PERIL THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO STRIKE IT LATER ON IF THE
FACTS TURNED OUT TO BE DIFFERENT, I SIMPLY WOULD LIKE TO TEST THE
SITUATION WITH THIS EXPERT.

*MR. GORDON:* MAY I RESPOND, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MR. GORDON:* AND I DO FEEL IT A HONOR TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP IN COURT
AND DISAGREE WITH MR. BAILEY. IN THEIR BRIEF THE DEFENSE BROUGHT FORTH A
SOCIAL SCIENCE ARGUMENT BASED ON, AS WE SAW IN COURT LAST WEEK, WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT EMPIRICAL DATA, AND IN THEIR BRIEF AND IN THEIR ARGUMENT AND
IN MR. UELMEN'S ARGUMENT THEY HAVE ASKED THIS COURT TO MAKE FINDINGS
SPECIFICALLY LINKED TO THAT ARGUMENT, NOT AS TO THE SPECIFICS OF THIS
CASE, BUT AS TO THIS -- THAT ARGUMENT. WE ARE PRESENTING EVIDENCE, I
HAVE BEEN ARGUING TO THIS COURT FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS, WITH REGARD TO
THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT ARGUMENT IN THE HEARING HERE AND HOW IN A GENERAL
SENSE THAT IN A GENERAL THEORY THESE INCIDENTS -- STRIKE THAT. IN A
GENERAL SENSE, IN A GENERAL THEORY, HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF BATTERING
MIGHT BE CONNECTED TOGETHER WITHIN A DESIGN; NOT AS TO THE SPECIFICS OF
THE CASE HERE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. GORDON:* GOING TO THAT LIMITED PURPOSE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. BAILEY, I'M GOING TO SUSTAIN THE OBJECTION
AT THIS POINT.

*MR. BAILEY:* ALL RIGHT.

*Q:* IS IT PART OF YOUR SCIENCE, DOCTOR, TO TRY TO IDENTIFY
CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH VICTIMS AND BATTERERS?

*A:* YES, IT IS.

*Q:* IN SUCH CASES?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* SO THAT YOU FORMULATE EVENTUALLY, DO YOU NOT, SORT OF A CHECKLIST?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH DR. LENORE WALKER?

*A:* YES, I AM.

*Q:* DO YOU KNOW HER?

*A:* YES, I DO.

*Q:* ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH HER WRITINGS?

*A:* YES, I AM.

*Q:* ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH HER CHECKLIST?

*A:* YES, I AM.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. DO YOU AGREE WITH THEM?

*A:* (NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE.)

*Q:* IN YOUR OWN PRACTICE?

*A:* GENERALLY, YEAH. YEAH.

*Q:* OKAY. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU WOULD EXPECT TO FIND IN A PERSON
THAT HAS BEEN BATTERED, CORRECT?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* AS SET FORTH IN HER BOOK THE BATTERED WOMAN, WHICH IS VERY
WELL-KNOWN IN YOUR PROFESSION, IS IT NOT?

*A:* YES, IT IS.

*Q:* AND SHE HAS DETAILED WHAT YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR, BOTH AS TO THE
VICTIM AND THE BATTERER, THAT IS, CHARACTERISTICS -- I BELIEVE COMMON
CHARACTERISTICS OF BATTERED WOMEN, SHE LISTS NINE. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
THEM?

*A:* RIGHT. WELL, MY MEMORY COULD USE A LITTLE BIT OF REFRESHING
ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF THOSE NINE CHARACTERISTICS.

*Q:* WOULD YOU LIKE A COPY OF THE BOOK?

*A:* YES.

*MR. BAILEY:* OKAY.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. BAILEY:* MAY I APPROACH THE WITNESS, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* YOU MAY.

*THE WITNESS:* THANK YOU. UH-HUH.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: WHAT IS THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC?

*A:* HAS LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

*Q:* DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION OR EVIDENCE BEFORE YOU AS TO WHETHER OR
NOT THE VICTIM IN THIS CASE HAD LOW SELF-ESTEEM?

*A:* I HAVE NO INFORMATION.

*MR. GORDON:* YOUR HONOR, OBJECTION. WE ARE GOING INTO THE SAME MATTER
OF INQUIRY, UNLESS YOU WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO ALL THIS, BUT WE ARE GOING
INTO EXACTLY THE SAME LINE OF INQUIRY.

*MR. BAILEY:* MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT, COUNSEL FOR THE PEOPLE JUST
DETAILED THINGS THAT ARE LOOKED FOR, SCALES THAT ARE USED,
MULTIPLICATIONS THAT ARE USED TO TRY AND IDENTIFY BATTERERS. I THINK I
AM ENTITLED TO GO INTO THAT SUBJECT AS FAR AS HE'S THE ONE THAT PUT THE
POWER WHEEL IN HIS BRIEF.

*MR. GORDON:* AS TO DIAGNOSING A PERSON, UNLESS WE WANT TO GET INTO
TESTIMONY ON BOTH SIDES AS TO PROFILING THIS PARTICULAR DEFENDANT AND
THIS VICTIM. THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF FACTS THAN SAYING ARE THERE
CERTAIN -- THESE ARE NINE CHARACTERISTICS OF A BATTERED WOMAN. WOULD YOU
AGREE THAT THESE ARE NINE CHARACTERISTICS OF A BATTERED WOMAN IN ANY
GENERAL POPULATION OF BATTERED WOMEN? I DON'T HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO THAT
QUESTION WHATSOEVER. TO NOW TAKE ANOTHER STEP AND SAY LET'S LOOK AT THIS
CASE WOULD BE LIKE FOR ME TO SAY DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT MR.
SIMPSON RIGHT NOW, WHICH I DIDN'T DO. THAT IS TWO VERY, VERY DIFFERENT
THINGS, AND THE SECOND ONE ISN'T GOING TO BE OFFERED HERE.

*MR. BAILEY:* IF IT PLEASE THE COURT, I HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED HE COULD
NOT ETHICALLY GIVE AN OPINION ABOUT MR. SIMPSON BECAUSE HE HAS NEVER
EXAMINED HIM, AND I DON'T INTEND TO ASK THAT QUESTION. I'M ASKING ABOUT
A SCIENCE OF STUDYING AND DEFINING BATTERED WOMEN AND BATTERERS WHICH
THE PROSECUTION HAS MADE RELEVANT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT.

*MR. BAILEY:* ALL RIGHT.

*Q:* WOULD YOU SIMPLY READ THEN THE BALANCE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT
ARE DEFINED.

*A:* OKAY. DR. WALKER'S LIST IS THAT BATTERED WOMEN HAVE LOW
SELF-ESTEEM, THAT THEY BELIEVE ALL THE MYTHS ABOUT BATTERING
RELATIONSHIPS, THAT THEY ARE TRADITIONALISTS ABOUT THE HOME, THEY
STRONGLY BELIEVE IN FAMILY UNITY AND PRESCRIBED FEMININE SEX-ROLE
STEREOTYPE, THEY ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BATTERER'S ACTIONS, THEY
SUFFER FROM GUILT, YET DENY THE TERROR AND ANGER THAT THEY FEEL, THAT
THEY PRESENT A PASSIVE FACE TO THE WORLD BUT HAVE THE STRENGTH TO
MANIPULATE THEIR ENVIRONMENT ENOUGH TO PREVENT FURTHER VIOLENCE AND
BEING KILLED, THAT THEY HAVE SEVERE STRESS REACTIONS WITH
PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLAINTS, AND THAT THEY USE SEX AS A WAY TO
ESTABLISH INTIMACY, AND THEY BELIEVE THAT NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO RESOLVE
THEIR PREDICAMENT EXCEPT THEMSELVES.

*Q:* NOW, TURNING OVER TO PAGE 36, DO WE HAVE A SIMILAR LIST DEFINING
WHAT WE MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND IN A BATTERER?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. AND WHAT ARE THOSE?

*A:* WE HAVE A LOW SELF-ESTEEM, BELIEVES ALL THE MYTHS ABOUT BATTERING
RELATIONSHIPS, IS A TRADITIONALIST BELIEVES IN MALE SUPREMACY AND THE
STEREOTYPED MASCULINE SEX ROLE IN THE FAMILY, BLAMES OTHERS FOR HIS
ACTIONS, HIS PATHOLOGICALLY JEALOUS, PRESENTS A DUAL PERSONALITY, HAS
SEVERE STRESS REACTIONS, DURING WHICH HE USES DRINKING AND WIFE
BATTERING TO COPE, FREQUENTLY USES SEX AS AN ACT OF AGGRESSION TO
ENHANCE SELF-ESTEEM IN VIEW OF WANING VIRILITY, MAY BE BISEXUAL, DOES
NOT BELIEVE HIS VIOLENT BEHAVIOR SHOULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. NOW, DO I CORRECTLY UNDERSTAND THAT AS TO NEITHER THE
VICTIM IN THIS CASE NOR THE DEFENDANT HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED TO MAKE ANY
ANALYSIS OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS?

*A:* THAT'S CORRECT.

*Q:* HAVE YOU MADE ANY REFERENCE IN THE TESTIMONY GIVEN TODAY TO THE
SO-CALLED POWER AND CONTROL WHEEL WHICH APPEARS IN THE BRIEF OF THE PEOPLE?

*A:* NO, I HAVE NOT.

*Q:* I BELIEVE YOU SAID YOU DO USE THAT, HOWEVER, AND RECOGNIZE IT?

*A:* I DO -- YEAH, WE USE IT IN OUR TREATMENT GROUPS, THAT'S TRUE.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT.

*A:* YEAH.

*Q:* NOW, IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT NO SPECIMEN IS LIKELY TO HIT EVERY
POINT ON THE CHECKLIST?

*A:* YES, THAT'S FAIR.

*Q:* AND THAT SOMEBODY THAT HIT NONE OF THE POINTS ON THE CHECKLIST
WOULD PROBABLY BE EXCLUDED AS A CANDIDATE?

*A:* I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.

*Q:* WHAT PERCENTAGE OF POINTS DO YOU LOOK FOR BEFORE YOU THINK YOU MAY
HAVE A CANDIDATE THAT NEEDS FURTHER EXAMINATION?

*A:* WELL, ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT DR. WALKER'S CHECKLIST OR THESE SCALES
THAT --

*Q:* THE DULUTH, MINNESOTA, POWER AND CONTROL WHEEL BLOWN UP OVER HERE A
GREAT BIG PICTURE?

*A:* WE DO NOT USE THAT SCALE OR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES. WE USE IT FOR
DIDACTIC PURPOSES WITHIN A TREATMENT PURPOSE. FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES WE
USE A VARIETY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN PRESENTED HERE
TODAY AND THAT I HAVE NOT DESCRIBED.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. NOW, IN ORDER TO PROPERLY ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
EXISTENCE OF ANY BATTERING IN THIS CASE --

*A:* YES.

*Q:* -- SINCE THE VICTIM S NO LONGER WITH US --

*A:* YES.

*Q:* -- YOU WOULD HAVE TO FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION, FOR AN EXAMINATION
PURPOSES, ON THE DEFENDANT, CORRECT?

*MR. GORDON:* OBJECTION, IT IS IRRELEVANT AND BEYOND THE SCOPE.

*THE COURT:* OVERRULED. YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION.

*THE WITNESS:* WELL, I THINK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS THAT WE HAVE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MAN HAS
WHAT WE CALL PROPENSITY FOR ABUSIVENESS OR NOT WERE NOT DESIGNED TO BE
USED WITH A PERSON IN MR. SIMPSON'S CIRCUMSTANCES.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: OKAY. SO YOU ARE SAYING THEN THAT TO EXAMINE HIM --

*A:* WOULD NOT BE FAIR. IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR USING THESE TESTS.

*Q:* OKAY. SO IF THIS WERE YOUR CASE, SO TO SPEAK, AND WE HAD ASKED YOU
TO EXAMINE MR. SIMPSON TO GIVE US AN OPINION, THERE ARE NO PSYCHOLOGICAL
TESTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE CAUSED TO BE ADMINISTERED TO LEARN ABOUT HIS
PERSONAL TRAITS?

*A:* I WOULDN'T USE THE ONES THAT WE TRADITIONALLY USED IN OUR RESEARCH
TO DIAGNOSE A PROPENSITY FOR ABUSIVENESS WITH A MAN WHO WAS INCARCERATED
UNDER THE CONDITIONS THAT MR. SIMPSON IS FACING. I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT
THAT WAS FAIR TO HIM AND I WOULDN'T HAVE USED THEM UNDER THOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES.

*Q:* IS IT BECAUSE OF HIS PRESENT CONFINEMENT THAT YOU WOULDN'T USE THEM
OR BECAUSE OF THE CHARGES PENDING OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON?

*A:* A COMBINATION REALLY.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT.

*A:* YEAH.

*Q:* WOULD YOU HAVE EXAMINED HIM PERSONALLY?

*A:* I WOULD HAVE EXAMINED HIM PERSONALLY, YEAH.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. NOW, RELATING ONCE AGAIN TO YOUR EXPERIENCE, AS I
UNDERSTAND IT, THE BULK OF IT IS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE DEFINED AS
BATTERERS, EITHER BY THEMSELVES OR BY A COURT?

*A:* THAT'S CORRECT.

*Q:* SO THAT WHEN THEY COME TO YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE? YOU ARE NOT
ANSWERING THE QUESTION IS THIS PERSON BATTERED?

*A:* WELL, OKAY. LET ME JUST SORT OF QUALIFY THAT SOMEWHAT. WE HAVE OF
COURSE GONE OUT AND COLLECTED CONTROL GROUP DATA FOR OUR TESTS SO WE
HAVE ADVERTISED IN NEWSPAPERS. WE'VE GOT BLUE COLLAR MEN, WE HAVE GOT
MEN FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE SCALE OUT
TO MEN WHO ARE SELF-DEFINED BATTERERS, SO WE HAVE SAMPLED ACROSS THE
BOARD TO CORROBORATE THE SCALES.

*Q:* OKAY BUT IN HOW MANY CASES IS SOMEONE SENT TO YOU AND YOU HAVE
DISCHARGED THEM AS NOT BEING A BATTERER? IN OTHER WORDS, A MISTAKE?

*A:* FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES OR TREATMENT PURPOSES?

*Q:* TREATMENT.

*A:* UMM, I WOULD SAY 15 PERCENT OF THE CASES WE RECEIVE MAYBE.

*Q:* DO NOT NEED WHATEVER IT IS YOU OFFER, IN YOUR JUDGMENT, AND AWAY
THEY GO?

*A:* YEAH, YEAH.

*Q:* HAVE YOU DONE STUDIES OR READ ABOUT STUDIES WHERE THERE WAS AN
ATTEMPT TO PREDICT, FROM INFORMATION GAINED ABOUT A BATTERER, AS TO WHAT
FUTURE CONDUCT THERE MIGHT BE?

*A:* YES. IN FACT, WE HAVE DONE ONE.

*Q:* UH-HUH.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* AND WHAT KIND OF ACCURACY HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE?

*A:* WELL, THIS IS -- I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND MY USING THE TERM
POSTDICTION STUDY.

*Q:* POST WHAT?

*A:* POSTDICTION STUDY, A RETROSPECTIVE PREDICTION STUDY. IN OTHER
WORDS, WHAT I MEAN IS THAT WE GO OUT AND COLLECT ALL THE DATA ON THE MEN
THAT WE THINK ARE ABUSIVE. SOME OF THEM ARE IN TREATMENT GROUPS AND SOME
OF THEM ARE MEN THAT HAVE ANSWERED NEWSPAPER ADS. WE DO THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES ON THESE MEN AND THEY WE TRY TO PREDICT WHETHER
THEIR WIVES ARE GOING TO TRY TO CLASSIFY THESE MEN AS ABUSIVE OR NOT.
OUR ACCURACY RATE IS AROUND 88 PERCENT.

*Q:* THAT WAS NOT THE THRUST OF MY QUESTION, BUT PERHAPS I DIDN'T WORD
IT TOO ARTFULLY?

*A:* OKAY.

*Q:* THESE ARE THE VICISSITUDES OF GIVE AND TAKE.

*A:* OKAY.

*Q:* WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS, IS IT PART OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, WHEN YOU
TREAT SOMEONE WHO HAS ALLEGEDLY MADE SOME KIND OF THREAT OR ENGAGED IN
SOME KIND OF VIOLENCE, TO PREDICT WHETHER IT WILL ESCALATE TO ITS
ULTIMATE FORM?

*A:* UMM, OKAY, I UNDERSTAND YOU. YES.

*Q:* OKAY.

*A:* YES, IT IS.

*Q:* NOW, WHAT DO THOSE STUDIES SHOW ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO EXAMINE
SOMEONE AND PROJECT WHETHER THEY WILL OR WILL NOT ENGAGE IN SERIOUS --

*A:* I DON'T HAVE EMPIRICAL DATA ON THAT I'M AFRAID.

*Q:* THAT REALLY HASN'T BEEN DONE?

*A:* NO.

*Q:* OKAY. SUPPOSING IN THE COURSE OF RUNNING YOUR CHECKLISTS, YOUR OWN
OR DR. WALKER'S OR WHICHEVER ONES YOU USE --

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* -- YOU FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE RADICALLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE TYPICAL
BATTERER.

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* IN SOME CATEGORY.

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* AS AN EXAMPLE --

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* -- I THINK YOU HAVE SAID IN THE -- AND THE LITERATURE SAYS THAT
BATTERERS LIKE TO CONTROL ECONOMICALLY THEIR VICTIMS TO A DEGREE --

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* -- SO THAT THEY CAN REWARD AND PUNISH, GIVE AND TAKE AND KEEP THEM
UNDER THEIR THUMB?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* NOW, IF YOU FIND SOMEONE WHO DOES JUST THE OPPOSITE --

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* -- GENEROUS, GIVING, PASSES TITLE ON POSSESSIONS, GIVES BEFORE
BEING ASKED, ET CETERA, DOES THAT FLY IN THE FACE OF BATTERER'S SYNDROME
OR CAN IT BE AN EXCEPTION?

*A:* WELL, IT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION. WHAT -- I HAVE TO KNOW A
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT PERSON AND I WOULD HAVE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT THE MOTIVATION IN GIVING, BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU ARE AWARE, THE
MOTIVES FOR GIVING ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE. SOMETIMES
THERE CAN BE A CONTROL MOTIVE BEHIND THE GIVING OF MONEY AS WELL, SO IT
IS HARD TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN THE ABSTRACT.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. WELL, SIMPLY PUT, IF I LOAN YOU MONEY, I HAVE SOME
CONTROL OVER YOU, CORRECT?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT, OR EVEN IF YOU GAVE ME MONEY YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME
CONTROL OVER ME BECAUSE I WOULD OWE YOU SOMETHING. I WOULD FEEL INDEBTED
TO YOU.

*Q:* A MORAL OBLIGATION?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* SUPPOSING I REPEATEDLY GIVE YOU MONEY AND YOU DON'T GIVE ME ANY
MONEY BACK?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* I KNOW THAT IS A DELECTABLE THING TO CONTEMPLATE, BUT JUST TAKE IT
HYPOTHETICALLY.

*A:* I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE REASONS WHY YOU ARE
GIVING ME MONEY. I MEAN, IT IS REALLY HARD TO COMMENT ON AN ABSTRACT CASE.

*Q:* SUPPOSING YOU ARE A WOMAN AND I LOVE YOU?

*A:* PARDON ME?

*Q:* SUPPOSING YOU ARE A WOMAN AND I LOVE YOU?

*A:* OKAY. I'M A WOMAN AND YOU LOVE ME AND YOU ARE GIVING ME THIS MONEY
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

*Q:* I'M GIVING YOU A CONDOMINIUM, A PORSCHE, A MERCEDES AND A FERRARI,
ALL IN YOUR NAME. IS THAT ECONOMIC CONTROL?

*A:* ARE YOU -- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THERE ARE ANY STRINGS ATTACHED?

*Q:* NO.

*A:* NO STRINGS ATTACHED?

*Q:* NO. WE AREN'T EVEN MARRIED.

*A:* I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT TO DO.

*Q:* WE ARE NOT EVEN MARRIED. YOU CAN TAKE OFF.

*A:* IF THERE WERE ABSOLUTELY NO STRINGS ATTACHED, THEN I WOULD AGREE
WITH YOU, THAT THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE MAGNANIMOUS TO THE NTH DEGREE AND
NOT A TYPE OF CONTROL.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

*A:* YES.

*Q:* NOW, YOU HAVE, I BELIEVE, SAID THAT TERMINATION OF A RELATIONSHIP
WHETHER BY DIVORCE OR REJECTION OR ANYTHING ELSE, IT IS AN IMPORTANT
ELEMENT USUALLY FOR BATTERERS THAT MAY TRIGGER THEIR CONDUCT?

*A:* YES, IT MAY.

*Q:* AND THAT JEALOUSY AND OFTEN VIOLENCE RESULTING IN JEALOUSY
RESULTING IN TURN FROM THE INSECURITY OF A PERSONAL IS OFTEN TYPICAL AND
AGAIN A TRIGGER OF SOME VIOLENCE?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* HOW MANY OF THE BATTERERS THAT YOU EXAMINED HAD COME UPON THEIR
EX-WIVES PERFORMING A SEX ACT AND DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT?

*A:* DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS.

*Q:* NEVER HAPPENED IN YOUR EXPERIENCE, DID IT?

*A:* OH, I WOULDN'T -- NO, I WOULDN'T SAY IT NEVER HAPPENED. I JUST
WOULD SAY, NO, I CAN RECALL IT BEING RECOUNTED TO ME IN TREATMENT
GROUPS, OKAY, BUT WE NEVER COUNTED THEM UP. WE NEVER MADE A SYSTEMATIC
STUDY.

*Q:* BUT IS THAT TYPICAL CONDUCT FOR A PERSON WHO IS JEALOUS?

*A:* WELL, AGAIN, I GUESS IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW THE SITUATION IS
BEING HANDLED. I MEAN, IF I JUST SIMPLY WALKED AWAY FROM IT AND WAS
UNFAZED BY IT, NO, IT WOULD BE ATYPICAL.

*Q:* BUT YOU DON'T DO THAT IN THIS CASE. YOU COME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND
VERY CORDIALLY GREET THE BENEFICIARY OF THE FELLATIO.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD SHOW OF EQUANIMITY, ISN'T IT?

*A:* TOWARD THE MAN.

*Q:* AND THE SAME WITH THE WOMAN, NO ANGER, NO CRITICISM, EXCEPT FOR THE
WELFARE OF THE CHILDREN. YOU READ THAT, DID YOU?

*MR. GORDON:* ASSUMES A FACT NOT IN EVIDENCE AND MISSTATES THE EVIDENCE.

*THE COURT:* MR. BAILEY, I THINK WE ARE DRIFTING BACK OVER.

*MR. BAILEY:* VERY WELL.

*THE COURT:* IN FACT, WE ARE MORE THAN DRIFTING. WE ARE RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE OF IT.

*MR. BAILEY:* YOUR HONOR, I WILL MAKE FOR THE FLANK QUICKLY.

*THE COURT:* PLEASE.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: IF ONE WERE TO HYPOTHETICALLY LEARN FROM A CLOSE
FRIEND THAT HE HAD BEEN HAVING RELATIONS WITH AN EX-WIFE AND NOT REACT,
THAT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT ATYPICAL FOR A BATTERER, WOULD IT NOT?

*A:* LEARNED FROM A CLOSE FRIEND THAT HIS WIFE WAS HAVING A RELATIONSHIP?

*Q:* YOU AND I ARE BUDDIES. I AM GETTING DIVORCED. I AM DIVORCED. AND
YOU AND I HAVE A COUPLE ONE NIGHT AND SAY, YOU KNOW, I WAS WITH GRETA
LAST NIGHT AND SHE WAS GREAT.

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* AND I SAID OKAY. SHE IS FREE. YOU KNOW, SHE IS DIVORCED. NO
REACTION. ISN'T THAT ATYPICAL?

*MR. GORDON:* THAT ASSUMES A FACT NOT IN EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE.

*MR. BAILEY:* I'M ASKING A HYPOTHETICAL.

*THE COURT:* OVERRULED.

*THE WITNESS:* HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION?

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: YES.

*A:* IT I WOULD ATYPICAL.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I COULDN'T HEAR THAT ANSWER.

*THE WITNESS:* IT WOULD BE ATYPICAL.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: UNUSUAL, NOT CONSISTENT?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* YOU HAVE I THINK FOCUSED YOUR MAIN CONCERN IN BATTERERS ON THE NEED
TO CONTROL ECONOMICALLY AND IN OTHER WAYS, RIGHT?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* WHEN ONE SHOWS NO INTEREST IN THE CONDUCT OF THE ALLEGED OBJECT OF
THE BATTERING, IS THAT NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE SYNDROME?

*A:* IF THE BATTERER SHOWS NO INTEREST IN THE WOMAN?

*Q:* RIGHT.

*A:* THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT.

*Q:* HAS REASON TO BELIEVE SHE IS COMING IN AT 3:00, 4:00 OR 5:00 IN THE
MORNING, BUT DOESN'T DO OR SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT, THAT IS INCONSISTENT,
ISN'T IT, WITH THIS FIERCE JEALOUSY THAT IS PART OF WHAT YOUR STUDY?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*THE COURT:* EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR. WHEN YOU SAY "UH-HUH" DO YOU MEAN YES OR
NO?

*THE WITNESS:* YES.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: IF WE CAN SURMOUNT THE BATTERY OF OUR COMMON LANGUAGE.

*A:* YES.

*Q:* DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE, WHEN YOU EVALUATE ONE OF THESE CASES,
AS TO WHAT THE HISTORY OF THE SUBJECT IS?

*A:* YES, IT DOES.

*Q:* OKAY.

*A:* YOU MEAN THE MAN'S PERSONAL HISTORY OR THE VICTIM'S HISTORY, THE
HISTORY OF THE RELATIONSHIP?

*Q:* YES.

*A:* THEY ALL ARE IMPORTANT.

*Q:* IF ONE WERE IN THE BUSINESS WHERE OTHERS WERE CONTINUALLY TRYING TO
BEAT, HURT AND BREAK HIM AND ONE DIDN'T REACT IN ANGER, WOULDN'T THAT BE
INCONSISTENT WITH THE KIND OF FRAIL PERSONALITY THAT WE FIND IN BATTERERS?

*A:* NOT NECESSARILY, BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT IS TRUE,
AND DR. WALKER MENTIONS THIS ALSO IN HER CHECKLIST, THAT IS, THERE DOES
SEEM TO BE ALMOST A KIND OF DUAL PERSONALITY WHERE THE RAGE IS DIRECTED
PRIMARILY TOWARDS AN INTIMATE WOMAN, SO THESE MEN DON'T ALWAYS
DEMONSTRATE ANGER AGAINST OTHER MEN, EVEN MEN WHO ARE ENGAGED IN
PHYSICAL PURSUITS WITH THEM.

*Q:* BEATING UP ON THEM?

*A:* YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT WOULD NOT -- BECAUSE A MAN IS PHYSICALLY
ABUSIVE AT HOME DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT HE WOULD SHOW AN ANGER
RESPONSE IN HIS INTERACTION WITH OTHER MEN.

*Q:* EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PHYSICALLY TRYING TO HURT HIM AND HE KNEW IT?

*A:* I MEAN IF HE HAS TO DEFEND HIMSELF, YES.

*Q:* I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DEFEND HIMSELF.

*A:* OKAY.

*Q:* YOU ARE COMING FROM A COUNTRY FAMOUS FOR RATHER A ROUGH SPORT
CALLED ICE HOCKEY?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* WHICH CAN BE VERY ASSAULTIVE?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE OUTBREAK OF LOSSES OF TEMPER BY THE
PLAYERS WHO FIGHT, TRUE?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* EVEN THOUGH IT IS AGAINST THE RULES TO FIGHT, THEY DO IT?

*A:* IT IS DEBATEABLE. THERE SEEMS TO BE A KIND OF PERMISSION TO DO
CERTAIN THINGS AND NOT DO CERTAIN OTHER THINGS. IF YOU KICK ANOTHER
PLAYER WITH A SKATE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IS A NO-NO, BUT IF YOU GET INTO A
FIST FIGHT WITH SOMEONE YOUR SIZE AT THE BLUE LINE, THEN THE REFEREES
LET THAT GO BECAUSE IT IS GOOD FOR THE GATE, SO --

*Q:* IT IS GOOD FOR THE GATE?

*A:* IT IS KIND OF AGAINST THE RULES AND IT IS KIND OF NOT AGAINST THE
RULES.

*Q:* IF YOU WHACK HIM HARD ENOUGH YOU CAN GET TRIED FOR MANSLAUGHTER?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE LADY BING TROPHY IS, DOCTOR?

*A:* YES, I DO.

*Q:* IS THAT NOT AWARDED TO THE PLAYER IN THE NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE WHO
SHOWS THE LEAST PROPENSITY --

*A:* GREATEST SKILLS WITH THE LEAST PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE.

*Q:* NOT MANY PENALTY MINUTES?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* DO YOU KNOW THE CAPTAIN OF A FOOTBALL TEAM, HOW HE GETS APPOINTED,
HOW HE GETS SELECTED?

*A:* NOT EXACTLY.

*Q:* WELL, HYPOTHETICALLY ASSUME --

*A:* YEAH.

*Q:* -- THAT HE IS SELECTED BECAUSE OF HIS GENERAL EQUANIMITY IN THE
FACE OF CONTINUOUS ASSAULTS AND HIS GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP AND FAIRNESS AS
WELL AS HIS ABILITY.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* WOULD THAT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE KIND OF PERSON YOU FIND SITTING
AT YOUR TABLE?

*A:* NOT NECESSARILY.

*Q:* IN OTHER WORDS, WOULD YOU BE SURPRISED TO FIND THE WINNER OF THE
LADY BING TROPHY BEING AN ASSAULTIVE PERSON?

*A:* UMM, THE LAST BOOK I WROTE ON THIS, THE PRINCIPLE DANCER OF THE NEW
YORK CITY BALLET HAD JUST BEEN ARRESTED FOR WIFE ASSAULT. I WOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED.

*Q:* OKAY. THAT IS TYPICAL OR WAS IT SO EXTRAORDINARY YOU PUT IT IN YOUR
BOOK?

*A:* NO, I JUST PUT IT IN THE BOOK TO SHOW THE FACT THAT THERE REALLY
ARE TWO PERSONALITIES AT WORK HERE AND YOU SIMPLY CAN'T DRAW CONCLUSIONS
ABOUT THE INTIMATE PERSONALITY FROM WHAT GOES ON IN TRANSACTIONS OUTSIDE
THE HOME.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. BUT THAT IS IN CASES WHERE YOU FIND IN FACT A DUAL
PERSONALITY, CORRECT?

*A:* RIGHT, BUT EVEN DR. WALKER IN HER LIST MENTIONED THIS KIND OF DUAL
PERSONALITY AS BEING TYPICAL OF BATTERERS.

*Q:* YES?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* CAN BE?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* BUT IF THE DUAL PERSONALITY ISN'T THERE, THEN THE PEACEFUL CONDUCT
IS CONTRAINDICATED IN A BATTERER, IS IT NOT?

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* IF YOU CAN'T TURN IT ON AND OFF?

*A:* WELL, YES, BUT I THINK THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT IT IS
FREQUENTLY THE CASE THAT THE DUAL PERSONALITY IS THERE AND TO DRAW
CONCLUSIONS OR INFERENCES ABOUT WHAT THE MAN IS LIKE IN TERMS OF HIS
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS WIFE ON THE BASIS OF HOW HE IS AND HIS
INTERACTIONS WITH MEN IN THE PUBLIC WORLD IS ERRONEOUS AND THAT IS SORT
OF ONE OF THE MYTHS THAT THE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA IS TRYING TO DISPEL.

THE TWO PERSONALITIES ARE -- YOU SIMPLY DIDN'T PREDICT ONE FROM THE OTHER.

*Q:* WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT IN SOME PEOPLE THOSE TWO OPPOSITES CAN
LIVE TOGETHER, IN NORMAL PEOPLE THEY DON'T LIVE TOGETHER, PEOPLE WITH
ONE PERSONALITY?

*A:* YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

*Q:* OKAY. NOW, HAS IT EVER BEEN PART OF YOUR BUSINESS TO DEAL NOT WITH
BATTERERS AS SUCH, BUT WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED HOMICIDE?

*A:* I HAVE ON OCCASION DEALT WITH PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED HOMICIDE, YES.

*Q:* ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY OF THE CHECKLISTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AS
TO WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECENTLY COMMITTED A HOMICIDE?

*A:* YES, I AM.

*MR. GORDON:* OBJECT AS TO VAGUE AS TO WHAT TYPE OF HOMICIDE AND
THEREFORE RELEVANCE OBJECTION.

*THE COURT:* OVERRULED.

*THE WITNESS:* I'M FAMILIAR WITH DR. DEITZ' CHECKLIST, FOR EXAMPLE, YES.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY; IN YOUR FIELD MOST OF THE HOMICIDES THAT YOU WOULD
COME IN CONTACT WITH WOULD BE RELATIONSHIP HOMICIDES, WOULD THEY NOT, AS
OPPOSED TO PAID ASSASSINATIONS?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* VEHICULAR?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* ET CETERA?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* OKAY. PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR TEMPER OR WORSE?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* AND IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE ARE SOME DEFINITIONS OF
PERSONALITY TRAITS, NOT PERSONALITY, BUT TRAITS OR ACTIONS OR CONDUCT,
THAT ARE LOOKED FOR --

*A:* YES.

*Q:* -- WHEN HOMICIDE HAS BEEN PERPETRATED AND IT IS KNOWN THAT THIS
PERSON IS THE PERPETRATOR?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* CAN YOU TELL US JUST OFFHAND HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE EXAMINED THAT
HAVE RECENTLY COMMITTED A HOMICIDE, SAY, 48, 72 HOURS, SOMETHING LIKE
THAT, IN A WEEK?

*A:* IN THE LAST 48 OR 72 HOURS?

*Q:* OR LAST WEEK WHILE THE SYMPTOMS ARE STILL PRESENT?

*A:* I HAVE --

*MR. GORDON:* OBJECT TO THAT. THAT ASSUMES A FACT NOT IN EVIDENCE.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: HYPOTHETICALLY?

*MR. GORDON:* WITH REGARDS TO SOME TYPE OF SYMPTOMS BEING PRESENT? ALSO
RELEVANCE OBJECTION TO THIS TYPE OF QUESTION.

*THE COURT:* OVERRULED. YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION.

*THE WITNESS:* WELL, I HAVE INTERVIEWED FOUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECENTLY --
WHO HAVE RECENTLY COMMITTED HOMICIDES.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: AND DID YOU FIND CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS ATYPICAL OF
THEIR FORMER PERSONALITY THAT WERE PRESENT THAT YOU COULD TRIBUTE TO THE
EXPERIENCE?

*A:* THEY WERE SLIGHTLY -- WELL, THE PROBLEM IS THEY WERE REALLY SORT OF
DIFFERENT HOMICIDES. TWO OF THEM WERE PARRICIDES. ONE OF THEM WAS A MAN
WHO KILLED HIS WIFE AND TWO OF HIS KIDS AND THEN TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF
AND THE GUN WOULDN'T FIRE. SO IT IS HARD TO SORT OF GO ACROSS COMMON
CHARACTERISTICS FOR ALL OF THESE CASES.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: WOULD YOU SAY THAT A TRAINED PERSON IN YOUR FIELD OR
IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY, WHICH IS CLOSELY RELATED, IS IT NOT, WHO HAD
INTERVIEWED 400 PEOPLE WHO HAD JUST COMMITTED A HOMICIDE WOULD BE OF
VALUE IN ANALYZING THE PERSON YOU HAD BEFORE YOU?

*A:* THEY SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

*Q:* THANK YOU. NOW, I BELIEVE IN YOUR DIRECT EXAMINATION YOU RELATED
THE FACT AND YOU CERTAINLY HEARD ARGUMENT HERE THAT THE GAPS IN
INCIDENTS MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELEVANT IN THE QUEST FOR AN ANSWER TO THE
QUESTION OF BATTERING, TRUE?

*A:* YES, YES.

*Q:* ARE YOU SAYING THAT EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE ARE INTERACTING ON A REGULAR
BASIS THAT THE INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE MAY BE VERY WIDELY SPACED?

*A:* THE INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE MAY BE WIDELY SPACED WHILE OTHER FORMS OF
ABUSE ARE OCCURRING IN THE INTERIM.

*Q:* OKAY. THE OTHER FORMS BEING THE ECONOMIC ABUSE?

*A:* AND THE EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND THE CONTROL.

*Q:* OKAY. DID YOU, IN REVIEWING MATERIAL IN THIS CASE, HAVE HANDED TO
YOU ANY DEPOSITIONS FROM THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS, JUST YES OR NO?

*A:* YES, I DID.

*Q:* INCLUDING THAT OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. DID YOU EXAMINE SOME DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED UP
BY THE PROSECUTION AS EXHIBITS IN THIS CASE, THOSE BEING LETTERS WRITTEN
BY THE DEFENDANT AND STIPULATED TO AS HIS HANDWRITING, TO THE VICTIM OF
THE 1989 INCIDENT?

*A:* YES, I DID.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. AND DID YOU FIND THAT AS TO ONE OF THOSE, AN OFFER WAS
MADE?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* "IF I EVER HIT YOU AGAIN I WILL TEAR UP THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT"?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY MILLIONS THAT AGREEMENT WAS WORTH ON THAT DATE?

*A:* NO, I DON'T.

*Q:* ASSUME THAT IT WAS WORTH SEVEN.

*A:* OKAY.

*Q:* ASSUME FURTHER THAT THE PROMISE WAS ATTESTED TO BY A LAWYER.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* AND WAS A VALID CONTRACT.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* AND ASSUME THAT FROM THAT DATE UNTIL JUNE 12, 1994, NO CLAIM WAS
EVER MADE AGAINST IT.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* WOULDN'T YOU INFER FROM THAT THAT THERE WERE NO INCIDENTS THAT
WOULD SUPPORT SUCH A CLAIM?

*MR. GORDON:* OBJECT -- WITHDRAW THE OBJECTION.

*THE WITNESS:* I WOULD INFER FROM THAT THAT THERE WERE NO INCIDENTS OF
PHYSICAL ABUSE TO SUPPORT THAT CLAIM, YES.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: OKAY. AND YOU DO KNOW THAT AS OF JUNE 11, 1992, THE
VICTIM IN THIS CASE SAID "NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO ME OF A PHYSICAL
NATURE SINCE 1989"?

*MR. GORDON:* OBJECT, ASSUMES A FACT NOT IN EVIDENCE, AND IT IS IRRELEVANT.

*MR. BAILEY:* I HAVE PAGES OF DEPOSITION HERE IF YOU WANT ME --

*MR. GORDON:* FINE, BUT IT GOES BEYOND WHAT THE COURT RULED THE SCOPE IS.

*THE COURT:* SUSTAINED.

*MR. BAILEY:* ALL RIGHT.

*Q:* NOW, DOCTOR, I TAKE IT THAT IN THOSE CASES WHERE A HOMICIDE HAS
TAKEN PLACE AND YOU WERE CONSULTED THAT THE QUESTION PUT TO YOU IS WHY?
IS IT CONNECTED, IS IT RELATED TO PRIOR CONDUCT, ET CETERA?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE, WHAT THEIR INTENT WAS?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* HAVE YOU ANY EXPERIENCE IN IDENTIFYING THE PERPETRATORS OF HOMICIDE
BY VIRTUE OF RESORT TO THE SYNDROME?

*A:* WHICH SYNDROME IS THAT?

*Q:* THE SO-CALLED BATTERING SYNDROME WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS?

*A:* I SEE. OKAY. NO.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. SO THAT YOUR EXPERTISE IS NOT IN DECIDING IF SOMEBODY
COMMITTED AN ACT BUT GENERALLY WHY?

*A:* THAT'S CORRECT.

*Q:* AND VERY FRANKLY, IN YOUR ENTIRE SCIENCE NO ONE HAS DEFINED AN
ABILITY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION "IF" AS AGAINST WHAT?

*MR. GORDON:* ASSUMES A FACT NOT IN EVIDENCE, IF THAT HAS EVER BEEN A
QUESTION.

*THE COURT:* OVERRULED. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION?

*THE WITNESS:* COULD YOU SAY IT AGAIN?

*MR. BAILEY:* YES.

*Q:* DO YOU KNOW OF ANY STUDIES OR PUBLICATIONS OR LEARNED PAPERS THAT
INSTRUCT YOU IN YOUR ILK AS TO WHAT STEPS TO TAKE IF SOMEONE COMES TO
YOU --

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* -- WITH SOME FACT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT SUPPORT BATTERY AND ASK YOU
TO USE THOSE TO IDENTIFY A PERPETRATOR RATHER THAN TO EXPLAIN HIS
MOTIVATIONS? YOU SAY YOU HAVE NEVER DONE IT. I'M ASKING YOU IF THAT
THERE ARE STUDIES THAT ENABLE PEOPLE TO DO IT?

*A:* ANY STUDIES THAT ARE KIND OF CHECKLISTS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THAT
WOULD CAUSE A THERAPIST TO LEAN TOWARDS, YES, THIS PERSON PROBABLY HAD
DONE IT, OR NO, THEY PROBABLY HAD NOT? IS THAT BASICALLY IT?

*Q:* YEAH. I'M NOT --

*A:* YES, THERE IS ONE. THERE IS ONE.

*Q:* ONE CASE? ONE STUDY?

*A:* WELL, THERE IS ONE STUDY, YES.

*Q:* IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WROTE?

*A:* NO, I DIDN'T WRITE IT.

*Q:* CAN YOU DEFINE IT FOR ME?

*A:* IT IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY DANIEL SONKIN WHO IS A
CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST IN SAUSALITO. IT IS A LEGALITY CHECKLIST THAT HE
HAS WORKED ON IN CASES OF THIS SORT.

*Q:* OKAY. DO YOU KNOW IF DR. SONKIN HAS EVER CLAIMED THAT ABSENT ANY
OTHER EVIDENCE IDENTIFYING A PERPETRATOR THAT ONE COULD DO IT FROM
EVIDENCE OF A BATTERING SYNDROME?

*A:* NOT JUST FROM A BATTERING SYNDROME ALONE, NO.

*Q:* YOU WOULD RUN AN AWFUL RISK THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE AN IRONCLAD
ALIBI?

*A:* TOO MANY FALSE POSITIVES. TOO MANY FALSE POSITIVES.

*Q:* OKAY. SO BY THE WAY, DOCTOR, I ASKED YOU YESTERDAY INFORMALLY IF
YOU COULD POINT ME IN THE DIRECTION OF SOME OF YOUR MANY WRITINGS THAT
WOULD BE RELEVANT TO WHAT WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY.

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* AND AT THAT POINT YOU WEREN'T SURE NOW WHY YOU WERE HERE TO DO
THAT, RIGHT?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* BUT SINCE BEEN EDUCATED?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* CAN YOU NOW DEFINE WHICH OF YOUR WRITINGS WE MIGHT READ THAT WOULD
HELP US ON THIS SUBJECT?

*A:* NOT ONLY DO THAT, BUT I GUARANTEE TO GIVE YOU AN AUTOGRAPHED BOOK
TOMORROW IN COURT.

*Q:* GOOD.

*A:* AND A LIST OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE RELEVANT. I
HAVE ASKED TO HAVE A COUPLE OF BOOKS FED EX'D HAD DOWN BECAUSE I WANT
YOU TO HAVE THEM.

*Q:* THAT IS VERY KIND.

*A:* I DIDN'T KNOW YESTERDAY EXACTLY WHAT DIRECTION I WOULD BE TESTIFYING.

*Q:* I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, I WILL SWAP YOU OUT.

*A:* IT IS A DEAL.

*THE COURT:* MR. GORDON.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION

BY MR. GORDON:

*Q:* A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO PUT YOU IN ANOTHER ROLE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS. LET'S TO GO MR. BAILEY'S HYPOTHETICAL
CHANGING -- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO YOU OR NOT. WE
ARE IN AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP, GIVING YOU THE PORSCHE, THE
CONDOMINIUM, THE BRACELETS, ALL THESE WONDERFUL GIFTS. WOULD IT BE
SIGNIFICANT TO YOU IF JUST PRIOR TO EACH OF THOSE GIFTS A CRITICAL
INCIDENT OF BATTERING OR A BATTERING HAD OCCURRED?

*A:* OH, YES, DEFINITELY.

*Q:* WHY?

*A:* WELL, BECAUSE THEN THE GIFT WOULD BE PART OF WHAT'S CALLED --
LENORE WALKER HERSELF CALLS IT THE CONTRITION PHASE, WHICH IS DOING
ANYTHING, SAYING ANYTHING, GIVING ANYTHING TO GET THE RELATIONSHIP BACK
ON EVEN KEEL AGAIN AND TO PREVENT THE WOMAN FROM LEAVING.

*Q:* IN FACT, IN LENORE WALKER'S STUDIES WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THERE IS
DISCUSSION OF ALMOST EXCESSIVE GIVING AT THIS CONTRITION OR HONEYMOON
PHASE, ISN'T THERE?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* ONE OF THE THREE PHASES OF A BATTERING?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* THE CRITICAL BATTERING OR THE BATTERING ITSELF?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* THE CONTRITION OR HONEYMOON?

*A:* AND TENSION BUILDING.

*Q:* AND THEN TENSION BUILDING?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* NOW, WE TALK ABOUT AND MR. BAILEY IS ASKING YOU QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
DUAL PERSONALITY THAT SOMETIME EXISTS IN BATTERERS.

*A:* YES.

*Q:* DOES THAT MEAN IF I AM THE BATTERER I THINK I AM A 17-YEAR OLD HIGH
SCHOOL STUDENT ON ONE DAY AND A 45-YEAR OLD WOMAN ON ANOTHER DAY, THAT
KIND OF DUAL PERSONALITY?

*A:* IT IS NOT DELUSIONAL THAT WAY. IT IS SIMPLY SOMEONE CHRONICALLY
ANGRY AND ABUSIVE AT HOME CAN PRESENT IN PUBLIC COMPLETELY AFFABLY,
NORMALLY, NONVIOLENTLY AND FREQUENTLY DO.

*Q:* AND IN FACT THAT PUBLIC PERSONA OR PUBLIC FACE, IS THERE A CERTAIN
KIND OF PERSONALITY YOU FIND THAT IS IN FACT PRESENTED BY BATTERERS?

*A:* I WOULD SAY THERE IS A VARIETY OF PUBLIC FACES AND THE ONLY THING
THAT REALLY DISTINGUISHES THEM IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS THIS VARIETY OF
WHAT APPEAR TO BE NORMAL ACCEPTABLE PERSONALITIES IN PUBLIC WHICH ARE
CONTRADICTED THROUGH BEHAVIOR AT HOME.

*Q:* IS THIS ONE CALLED A NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER OR
NARCISSISM THAT IS ENGAGED IN MUCH OF WHAT YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT?

*A:* WELL, THERE IS TYPICALLY THOUGHT TO BE THREE DIFFERENT KIND OF
BATTERERS AND THERE IS ONE THAT IS CALLED EMOTIONALLY VOLATILE AND THE
DSM3 AND DSM4, IT IS CALLED CLUSTER B EXTREME PERSONALITY, BORDERLINE
PERSONALITY, NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY AND WHAT IS CALLED AGGRESSIVE
SADISTIC PERSONALITY.

*Q:* WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY"?

*A:* A NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY WILL BE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN EXAGGERATED
OR A GRANDIOSE VIEW OF THEIR OWN APPEARANCE WHO NEEDED A CONSTANT KIND
OF REINFORCEMENT, WHO OVERREACTED TO ANY KIND OF SLIGHT CRITICISMS AND
WAS INCAPABLE OF DEVELOPING EMPATHY WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

*Q:* ALWAYS WANT TO BE CENTER OF THE ATTENTION?

*A:* YEAH.

*Q:* AND THAT PERSONALITY THEY PUT FORTH IN PUBLIC, IS THAT THE SAME,
THIS INTIMATE PERSONALITY? COULD THAT INTIMATE PERSONALITY BE THE
VIOLENT ONE?

*A:* COULD BE.

*Q:* MR. BAILEY ASKED YOU ABOUT SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WALKING IN ON
SOMEONE AND THE JEALOUSY THAT WOULD OCCUR.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* DO YOU REMEMBER THOSE QUESTIONS?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* IS FOLLOWING THE OBJECT OF CONTROL OR THE BATTERED WIFE OR STALKING
SOMETHING YOU HAVE SEEN BEFORE?

*A:* YES, IT IS.

*Q:* IS THIS AN IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR?

*A:* IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR.

*Q:* DO YOU SEE THAT KIND OF JEALOUSY, FOLLOWING, I'M WATCHING OVER YOU
KIND OF BEHAVIOR A LOT IN THESE CASES?

*A:* WE SEE IT FREQUENTLY. IT IS AN EXTENSION OF THE DOMINANCE CONTROL
FACTOR THAT I PUT UP HERE ON THE BOARD. IN FACT, IF YOU WANT IT, IF I
CAN REALLY ANSWER THIS, JUST PULL THIS DOWN, THIS IS THE FIRST HALF OF A
SCALE THAT WE ARE USING IN OUR RESEARCH BECAUSE WE ARE STUDYING THIS
VERY TOPIC, INTRUSIVENESS, AND WE HAVE TAKEN A LIST OF BEHAVIORS AND WE
HAVE ASKED WOMEN WHO ARE ESTRANGED FROM MEN WITH WHOM THEY HAD BATTERING
RELATIONSHIPS TO MAKE A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS THAT THIS PERSON DID, AND
THAT IS JUST THE FIRST HALF OF THE SCALE AND HERE IS THE SECOND HALF OF
THE SCALE.

*Q:* AND HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WITH REGARD
TO STALKING?

*A:* WELL, WHAT IT -- IT RELATES IN THIS WAY: MEN WHO ARE PARTICULARLY
CONTROLLING AND DOMINATING WHEN THEY ARE IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
WOMAN ARE THE ONES WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN THESE KIND OF
INTRUSIONS AFTER THAT RELATIONSHIP TERMINATES.

*Q:* NOW, WHEN YOU SAY "INTRUSIONS," COULD THAT BE FOLLOWING SOMEONE?

*A:* IT COULD BE.

*Q:* GOING TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE?

*A:* UNWARRANTED GOING TO THAT PERSON'S HOUSE, YES.

*Q:* HOW ABOUT CALLING THEN ALL THE TIME UNWANTED?

*A:* IF IT IS UNWANTED, YES, DEFINITELY.

*Q:* SENDING THEM GIFTS OR GIVING THEM THINGS TO LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU
ARE THINKING OF THEM AND WATCHING THEM?

*A:* THE KEY HERE IS THAT THE WOMAN HAS MADE SOME KIND OF INDICATION
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT THIS AND THE MAN CONTINUES TO INTRUDE ON THE
WOMAN'S LIFE.

*Q:* IT IS INTERESTING -- WELL, YOU WERE ANSWERING MR. BAILEY'S
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS JEALOUSY. YOU SAID THIS KIND OF INTERACTION BETWEEN
THE BATTERER AND THE MAN MIGHT NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH CONTROL. YOU
SEEMED TO INFER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME REAL PROBLEMS OF JEALOUSY WITH
THE WOMAN?

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* IS THAT YES, SIR?

*A:* THAT IS A YES.

*Q:* WHY?

*A:* WHY IS THE MAN MORE OF AN ISSUE THAN THE WOMAN?

*Q:* THE HYPOTHETICAL HE GAVE YOU WHERE THIS MAN CAME ON HIS WIFE AND HE
HAD SEEN SOMETHING OCCUR AND HE RELATED FRIENDLY TO THE MAN, THAT MIGHT
NOT MEAN A LOT TO THE MAN, BUT IT MIGHT MEAN SOMETHING TO THE WOMAN?

*A:* MY OWN SORT OF TAKE ON THAT IS MEN WHO ARE -- THE KIND OF MEN WHO I
AM LOOKING AT THAT ARE ABUSIVE, THEIR PREDOMINANT RAGE, IS WITH A WOMAN.
THEY ARE FREQUENTLY BUDDIES WITH MEN. THEY GET ALONG FINE WITH MEN.
WOMEN ARE KIND OF LIKE A LIGHTENING ROD FOR ALL THE EMOTIONAL STORMS IN
THEIR LIFE. FREQUENTLY UNLIKELY TO DISPLAY ANY KIND OF RAGE TOWARD A MAN.

*Q:* AND WHEN THEY DO DISPLAY THIS RAGE, IS IT USUALLY IN PUBLIC OR WHEN
THEY GET PRIVATE -- TO THAT PRIVATE PERSONALITY?

*A:* TOWARD THE WOMAN IT WOULD BE IN PRIVATE.

*Q:* NOW, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS HYPOTHETICAL ABOUT SOME KIND OF DOCUMENT,
THIS PROMISE. IS THE PROMISE THE KIND OF THING THAT COULD OCCUR, THIS
KIND OF PROMISE OF GENEROSITY, WITHIN THIS CONTRITION PHASE?

*A:* YES, IT IS.

*Q:* AND THEN NOTHING HAPPENING IN A BATTERED WOMAN'S LIFE BECAUSE
NOTHING IS REPORTED, DOES THAT MEAN NOTHING IS HAPPENING?

*A:* OH, NO. THAT MEANS SHE IS NOT REPORTING ANYTHING.

*Q:* DO BATTERED WOMEN LEARN IN ANY WAY NOT TO REPORT?

*A:* WELL, OCCASIONALLY I MEAN WHEN -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN
WITH SOME BATTERED WOMEN IS IF THEY REPORT SOMETHING AND IT GETS FOUND
OUT, THE HUSBAND DISCOVERS IT AND IT BECOMES A CAUSE OF FUTURE
CONSTERNATION, THEN SHE REALLY STOPS TALKING AND STOPS EVEN WRITING A
DIARY. OR IF SHE KEEPS A DIARY SHE REALLY KEEPS IT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.
SHE HAS GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE
IS SAYING. THAT IS DANGEROUS FOR HER.

*Q:* BATTERED WOMEN ARE HYPER VIGILANT, CORRECT?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* THEY WATCH EVERYTHING THEY SAY, DO, WHERE THEY GO, WHAT THEY DO,
BECAUSE THEY KNOW A LOT OF THOSE INNOCUOUS THINGS MIGHT BE TRIGGERS?

*A:* THAT'S RIGHT.

*Q:* MR. BAILEY WAS ASKING YOU QUESTIONS ABOUT DETERMINING IF A SPOUSAL
HOMICIDE MIGHT OCCUR WITHIN YOUR FIELD.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* LET ME ASK YOU THIS, SIR: DOES YOUR FIELD LOOK AT WHY THEY OCCUR?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* AND IS JEALOUSY AND ESTRANGEMENT A BIG REASON?

*A:* YES, THEY ARE THE MAIN REASONS.

*Q:* TERRIFYING LOVE IS A BOOK WRITTEN BY DR. WALKER, CORRECT?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT, SIR?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* AND IN FACT IN THAT BOOK DOESN'T SHE SAY THAT SEPARATION CREATES A
PERIOD OF UNPRECEDENTED DANGER?

*MR. BAILEY:* COUNSEL, WOULD YOU RETURN THE COURTESY AND GIVE ME THE
PAGE NUMBER?

*MR. GORDON:* CERTAINLY, SIR. 65.

*THE WITNESS:* THAT'S RIGHT. AND ALL EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN
DONE ON INTIMATE HOMICIDE SAY EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

*MR. GORDON:* COULD I HAVE JUST A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*Q:* BY MR. GORDON: NOW, ONE QUESTION. WITH REGARD TO THIS PERIOD OF
WHERE A WOMAN DOESN'T DISCLOSE, WOULD IT BE SIGNIFICANT IF SHE WAS
CHRONICLING HER OWN ABUSE PRIVATELY?

*A:* IF SHE WAS --

*Q:* CHRONICALLY, KEEPING RECORDS OF HER OWN ABUSE PRIVATELY?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* WHY WOULD THAT BE SIGNIFICANT?

*A:* WELL, IT WOULD SAY TO ME THAT SHE WAS, FIRST OF ALL, BEING HYPER
VIGILANT IN TERMS OF HER DISCLOSURES. I MEAN, SHE WAS KIND OF LIKE
KEEPING A SECRET, SECRET, SECRET DIARY, AND IT MIGHT ALSO MEAN THAT SHE
WAS PLANNING -- PUTTING EVIDENCE IN PLACE BECAUSE SHE WAS PLANNING SOME
KIND OF LEGAL ACTION.

*Q:* COULD IT BE BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID?

*A:* CERTAINLY SHE IS AFRAID. THAT IS WHY SHE IS KEEPING IT SO SECRET.

*Q:* HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A CASE WHERE A WOMAN HAS EXPRESSED FEAR, IN
FACT EXPRESSED FEAR OF BEING POSSIBLY KILLED BY THE BATTERER AND YET NOT
LEFT?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* WHY IS THAT?

*A:* WELL, I'VE HEARD OF CASES -- I'VE HEARD OF SOME WOMEN WHO ARE
AFRAID TO STAY WITH THEM AND AFRAID TO LEAVE THEM BOTH AND THEY ARE
CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO OPPOSING FEARS AND THE DECISION THEY MAKE IS THAT
THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE SAFER TO STAY AND RIDE IT OUT THAT IF THEY
LEAVE THEY ARE GOING TO DEAD FOR SURE.

*Q:* IS IT IN FACT CORRECT THAT THAT ACT OF SEPARATION WE TALKED ABOUT
EARLIER, IT MIGHT BE EVEN A SMALL ACT, BUT WHEN THAT ESTRANGEMENT OR
SEPARATION OCCURS, THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME FOR SUCH A WOMAN?

*A:* THE RISK RATIO MAGNIFIES HER CHANCES OF BEING KILLED BY A FACTOR OF 6.

*MR. GORDON:* I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU, SIR.

*MR. BAILEY:* I HAVE A COUPLE, YOUR HONOR.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION

BY MR. BAILEY:

*Q:* BEFORE I HURL THE QUESTION AT YOU, DOCTOR, HAD ANYONE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE PORSCHE, THE MERCEDES, THE FERRARI AND THE CONDOMINIUM?

*A:* TOLD ME ABOUT IT?

*Q:* SO YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT THOSE GIFTS WERE TRIGGERED BY
ANY ACT OR JUST OUT OF GENEROSITY?

*A:* NO, I DON'T KNOW.

*MR. GORDON:* OBJECTION. ASSUMED IN OUR HYPOTHETICAL AGAIN, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* NO.

*MR. GORDON:* OKAY.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: NOW --

*THE COURT:* SINCE WE DON'T HAVE A JURY HERE, I GIVE RATHER BROAD LEEWAY.

*MR. GORDON:* I UNDERSTAND.

*THE COURT:* WHEN WE GET TO TRIAL IT WILL BE VERY STRICT.

*MR. BAILEY:* BUT HOPEFULLY NOT FEDERAL.

*THE COURT:* TOUCHE.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: DR. BUTTON --

*A:* YES.

*Q:* -- IS IT TYPICAL FOR A VICTIM OF BATTERING WHO GOES THROUGH A
DIVORCE, ESTABLISHES A LIFE OF HER OWN WITH A REASONABLY HARMONIOUS
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EX WHO HAS GOT A LIFE OF HIS OWN AND A LOVE OF HIS
LIFE --

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* -- TO WANT TO MOVE BACK IN AND TO SUGGEST IT?

*A:* ONLY IF SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD CHANGE.

*Q:* OKAY. BUT IF SHE IS OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND IS A VICTIM, SHE IS
HARDLY LIKELY TO DEMAND TO GET BACK INTO IT, TRUE?

*A:* WELL, LET ME -- YES AND NO. LET ME JUST QUALIFY THAT A LITTLE BIT.

*Q:* IF NOT THREATENED?

*A:* OKAY.

*Q:* IF NOT THREATENED?

*A:* IF NOT THREATENED.

*Q:* THIS IS MY HYPOTHETICAL, DOCTOR.

*A:* IF NOT THREATENED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS ALSO TRUE ABOUT
BATTERING RELATIONSHIPS THAT FREQUENTLY GOES OVERLOOKED IS THAT MEN WHO
ARE ABUSIVE WITH WOMEN ARE NOT CHRONICALLY ABUSIVE. THEY WERE NOT
ABUSIVE EVERY DAY. THERE IS FREQUENTLY GREAT TIMES IN BETWEEN, AND WOMEN
REPORT THIS. AND THERE IS A LOT OF REALLY ATTRACTIVE QUALITIES SOMETIMES
ABOUT THE MAN WHO IS ALSO ABUSIVE. WOMEN COME INTO -- COME TO US ALL THE
TIME -- OR MEN COMING INTO OUR GROUPS SAY, I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE GUY,
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE RELATIONSHIP, I WANT HIM TO STOP BEING VIOLENT.
IF HE STOPPED BEING VIOLENT, HE'S REALLY A SWEET GUY, SO THERE COULD BE
A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS THAT WOULD DRAW THAT WOMAN BACK IF SHE FELT
THAT MAN HAD NOW DIMINISHED HIS ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.

*Q:* JUST ASSUME THEN, HYPOTHETICALLY, THAT A YEAR AFTER THE DIVORCE
TAKES PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF '92, SAY, MAY OF '93, THE VICTIM SAYS I
WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* COULD WE TRY IT FOR A YEAR, HER INITIATIVE.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* AND AT THE END OF THAT YEAR THE ALLEGED BATTERER SAYS, I'M SORRY,
HONEY, IT IS NOT WORKING AND WE ARE GOING TO TERMINATE. IS THAT TYPICAL
CONDUCT IN THE BATTERED COUPLE?

*A:* NO. IF HE WERE THE ONE THAT INITIATED THE SPLIT, THAT WOULD NOT BE
TYPICAL.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. LET'S TAKE IT ONE FURTHER.

*A:* OKAY.

*Q:* SUPPOSING THE VICTIM, WHO IS NOT ALLOWED TO MOVE BACK INTO THE
MARITAL HOME, THE FORMER MARITAL HOME, NONETHELESS HAS HER MAIL SENT
THERE AS A PRELUDE TO AN ADVANCE.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* ASSUME THAT AND ASSUME THAT WHEN THE VICTIM DISCOVERS THAT SHE
CANNOT GET ALONG WITH THE LIVE-IN MAID SHE BEATS HER UP PHYSICALLY.

*A:* UH-HUH.

*Q:* IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH A WOMAN WHO IS TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM A
THREATENING RELATIONSHIP OR ONE WHO IS TRYING TO GET BACK INTO A
RELATIONSHIP?

*A:* THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH ANY PATTERN I HAVE EVER HEARD OF.

*Q:* IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH A WEAK WOMAN, IS IT?

*A:* NO, BUT I MEAN IT COULD BE CONSISTENT WITH A WOMAN WHO IS PRETTY
ANGRY.

*Q:* AT THE MAID?

*A:* WELL, ABOUT SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- I MEAN, IT IS A
HYPOTHETICAL CASE. IT IS HARD TO SAY, BUT SHE IS PLENTY ANGRY ABOUT
SOMETHING.

*Q:* ALL RIGHT. LAST QUESTION.

*A:* OKAY.

*Q:* IF THE SOLE EVIDENCE ALLEGED, AND I THINK YOU HEARD THE DATE --

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* -- OF ECONOMIC ABUSE WERE TO GET A LAWYER TO TELL THE VICTIM NOT TO
CONSPIRE TO DEFRAUD THE UNITED STATES OUT OF $90,000, IS THAT ECONOMIC
ABUSE OR IS THAT GOOD SENSE?

*MR. GORDON:* OBJECT. IT IS AN INCOMPLETE HYPOTHETICAL AND GOES BEYOND
THE SCOPE.

*THE COURT:* OVERRULED.

*THE WITNESS:* IT IS REALLY HARD TO ANSWER THAT WITHOUT KNOWING THE
CONTEXT.

*MR. BAILEY:* FINE, FINE.

*THE WITNESS:* OKAY.

*Q:* BY MR. BAILEY: NOT TOO MUCH LONG PRIOR TO THE UNFORTUNATE EVENTS
THAT BRING US HERE TODAY.

*A:* YEAH.

*Q:* THE VICTIM, WHO HAS SOLD A RENTAL PROPERTY AND PURCHASED ANOTHER --

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* -- IN WHICH SHE IS LIVING WHICH UNDER U.S. TAX LAWS WOULD TRIGGER A
CAPITAL GAINS LIABILITY OF ABOUT NINETY GRAND, ACCORDING TO HER
ACCOUNTANT --

*A:* RIGHT.

*Q:* -- WHICH THE DEFENDANT HAS INSISTED SHE ESCROW IN CASE UNCLE SAM
CATCHES UP, WANTS HIM TO SWEAR THAT SHE IS LIVING IN HIS HOUSE WHEN IT
IS NOT TRUE AND HE HAS HIS LAWYER SAY WE CAN'T DO THAT, THAT IS
CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT A FEDERAL FELONY, DON'T DO IT, IS THAT ECONOMIC ABUSE?

*A:* HE IS JUST FOLLOWING HIS LAWYER'S ORDERS -- THE WAY YOU ARE PUTTING
IT TO ME, HE IS FOLLOWING HIS LAWYER'S ORDERS.

*Q:* HAVE YOU SEEN A COPY OF THE LAWYER'S LETTER OR DIDN'T THEY SHOW YOU
THAT?

*MR. GORDON:* IS THAT THE HYPOTHETICAL LETTER, YOUR HONOR?

*MR. BAILEY:* HYPOTHETICAL LETTER THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR FILES.

*THE COURT:* WELL, COUNSEL, I ASSUME WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IS A LITTLE
PRETRIAL DISCOVERY IS WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.

*MR. GORDON:* I FIGURED THAT, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* YEAH.

*MR. BAILEY:* WE HAVE A COPY, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*Q:* IF THAT IS THE SOLE EXAMPLE WOULD YOU SAY THAT THAT DOES NOT
AMOUNT, IN YOUR EXPERIENCE --

*A:* I WOULD SAY THE WAY THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING THE CASE TO ME, THIS
MAN WOULD SIMPLY BE FOLLOWING HIS LAWYER'S ORDERS.

*MR. BAILEY:* OKAY.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, THIS LETTER IS NOT GOING TO BE REALLY HELPFUL TO
ME IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION.

*MR. BAILEY:* WE WITHDRAW IT, YOUR HONOR. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, JUDGE.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. GORDON:* PROMISE JUST A COUPLE.

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION

BY MR. GORDON:

*Q:* YOU HEARD MR. BAILEY USE THE TERM "A WEAK WOMAN." BECAUSE A WOMAN
IS A VICTIM OF BATTERING, DOES THAT MEAN SHE IS WEAK?

*A:* NO, NOT AT ALL.

*Q:* ARE YOU FAMILIAR -- YOU HEARD ABOUT -- SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT A WOMAN
RETURNING BACK AND GOING BACK TO THE BATTERER. ARE YOU FAMILIAR -- I
SAID A COUPLE. ARE YOU FAMILIAR -- ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY STUDIES
THAT TALK ABOUT THE EFFECT UPON A WOMAN UPON HER ATTACHMENT OR HER
BONDING TO A MAN WHEN SHE HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO UNPREDICTABLE OR
INTIMATE VIOLENCE?

*A:* I WROTE THREE OF THEM.

*Q:* DOES IT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THE ATTACHMENT?

*A:* YES.

*Q:* WHAT IS THAT?

*A:* WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS WITH BATTERED WOMEN IS THAT IS
SOMETHING CALLED TRAUMATIC BONDING WHICH IS A KIND OF PECULIAR PROCESS,
BUT BASICALLY IT WORKS LIKE THIS: WE GET ATTACHED TO PEOPLE WHO
INTERMITTENTLY TREAT US WELL, BADLY, WELL, BADLY, WHERE THERE IS
POSITIVE-NEGATIVE REPEATED BEHAVIOR. ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMATIC
BONDING IS THAT WITH TIME AWAY FROM THE ABUSER A WOMAN FORGETS THE
NEGATIVE STUFF AND REMEMBERS WHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP. I
HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN WITHIN A WEEK, BUT IT CAN CERTAINLY TAKE A LONGER
TIME PERIOD.

*MR. GORDON:* I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. BAILEY, ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS?

*MR. BAILEY:* NOTHING FURTHER, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. DR. BUTTON, YOU CAN STEP
DOWN. THANK YOU, SIR.

*MR. GORDON:* CAN I FINISH UP REAL QUICK, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. GORDON:* YOUR HONOR, THE INFORMATION THAT IS BEING TALKED ABOUT IN
THIS CASE MUST -- MUST BE CONSIDERED WITHIN THE LIGHT OF WHAT WE KNOW
ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SPOUSAL ABUSE, ABOUT THE MOTIVES, THE
CONNECTIONS, THE PATTERNS. WHAT THE COURT SHOULD CONSIDER, AND WHAT I
FIND INTERESTING IN LOOKING AT THESE CASES, IS THERE IS A LOT OF
LITERATURE, LEGALLY AND EMPIRICALLY, IN DIFFERENT KIND OF CASES, AND THE
SAME IS TRUE WITH REGARD TO PATRICIDE CASES AND SPOUSAL ABUSE -- KILLING
CASES, BOTH THE CASES WHERE THE BATTERER, THE MAN, HAS KILLED THE WIFE
AND VICE VERSA, AND WHAT IS INTERESTING TO NOTICE, THAT IF THIS WAS A
CASE WHERE THE WOMAN WAS ON TRIAL FOR KILLING HER HUSBAND IN
SELF-DEFENSE, ALLEGING ESSENTIALLY THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME TYPE
KILLING CASE, IT IS CLEAR FROM ARIS, DAY, ALL THOSE CASES, THAT ALL OF
THIS EVIDENCE WOULD COME IN. AND GOING BACK AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, IN
PATRICIDE CASES, IT IS CLEAR THAT WHERE THE ARGUMENT IS THAT WE NEED TO
SHOW THIS PATTERN OF ABUSE TO EXPLAIN THIS DEFENSE, THE ENTIRE HISTORY
COMES IN, EVERYTHING, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY OF THE CONCERNS REGISTERED
HERE TODAY. AND IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE VARIOUS POSITIONS, THAT
WHEN A WOMAN HAS KILLED HER BATTERER, IT IS ARGUED THROUGHOUT THE
LITERATURE, LEGAL, EMPIRICAL, SCIENTIFIC LEGAL REVIEW COMMENTARIES, THAT
IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNJUST FOR THE TRIER OF FACT TO CONSIDER WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT HOMICIDE WITHOUT THAT HISTORY, EVERY BIT OF THAT HISTORY. AND
WHAT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE, THAT IN THOSE CASES IT IS ONLY GOING TO ONE
ISSUE, AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF REASONABLENESS WITH INTENT AND DEGREE
GOING TO ONE VERY SMALL ISSUE. AND YET HERE UNDER VERY TRADITIONAL
ANALYSIS, WITHOUT EVER GETTING WITHIN -- TO THE INFORMATION WE HAVE
DISCUSSED TODAY OF A COMPELLING INFORMATION ABOUT BATTERED WOMAN'S
SYNDROME AND THE LIKE AND BATTERERS SYNDROME AND ALL THE SCIENCE
SURROUNDING IT, WHICH IS MUCH MORE EXPANSIVE THAN JUST THE BATTERED
WOMAN'S SYNDROME, IT IS COMPELLING THAT WHAT HAS OCCURRED TO THAT WOMAN
MUST COME IN BEFORE -- BEFORE THE TRIER OF FACT. HER LIFE AND HER DEATH
CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD. AND IF IT IS APPROPRIATE AND JUST FOR A WOMAN WHO
HAS ESSENTIALLY ESCAPED THE BATTERING TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION COME
BEFORE A TRIER OF FACT, IT IS ABSOLUTELY BY POLICY AND THE LAW
IMPERATIVE FOR IT TO COME IN WHEN A WOMAN -- BATTERER IS ON TRIAL. THANK
YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU, COUNSEL. ALL RIGHT. MR. UELMEN, WHAT IS YOUR
TIME ESTIMATE TO YOUR RESPONSE? *MR. UELMEN:* ABOUT AN HOUR, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. DARDEN, THEN I'M -- I DON'T THINK WE WILL
GET TO THE FUHRMAN MOTION TODAY IS MY GUESS.

*MR. DARDEN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WILL YOU BE ABLE TO ARGUE THAT TOMORROW MORNING?

*MR. DARDEN:* YES, ALONG WITH DEPUTY D.A. LEWIS, YOUR HONOR. BEFORE I
GO, HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE WITH THE COURT -- WITH THE COURT AND
DEFENSE COUNSEL TWO ITEMS. THE FIRST IS A CHAPTER FROM A BOOK CALLED TWO
NATIONS, BLACK AND WHITE, SEPARATE, HOSTILE, UNEQUAL. IT IS BY ANDREW
HACKER AND IT WAS PUBLISHED IN 1992. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE WITH THE
COURT AND COUNSEL A STUDY FROM THE AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW, VOLUME
56, IT IS PUBLISHED IN 1991. IT IS ENTITLED THE CONTINUING SIGNIFICANCE
OF RACE, ANTI-BLACK DISCRIMINATION IN PUBLIC PLACES. IT IS GOING TO BE
OUR POSITION THAT THE COURT SHOULD HAVE SOME FEELING OF WHAT IT MEANS OR
WILL MEAN FOR BLACK JURORS TO HEAR IN THIS CASE THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN
MAY HAVE USED THE "N" WORD SOME FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, AND WE
WILL BE ARGUING THAT EVIDENCE SHOULDN'T COME IN, THAT IT WILL POSE
SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE TO THE PROSECUTION'S CASE IN THE EVENT THAT THE
COURT ALLOWS THOSE SLURS IN THE EVIDENCE, AND SO I LEAVE THIS WITH MR.
COCHRAN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I KNOW WHAT IT IS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WORD VERY CLEARLY
AND I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE THE ISSUE NOW, BUT I DON'T THINK THE COURT
NEEDS DR. HACKER'S BOOK IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A
RACIAL INSULT VISITED UPON ONE. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A JURY THAT IS
A DIVERSE JURY I THINK DOES VIOLENCE TO THE CONCEPT OF A DIVERSE JURY
AND IT BELITTLES THEIR INTELLIGENCE TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY CAN'T
UNDERSTAND --

*THE COURT:* MR. COCHRAN, WE ARE NOT HEAR TO ARGUE THE MOTION AT THIS
POINT. I'M ASKING FOR TIME ESTIMATES.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I UNDERSTAND. I'M ONLY RESPONDING TO COUNSEL. I THOUGHT
WE WERE HEAR TO LET HIM GO HOME.

*MR. DARDEN:* I'M PLEASED TO HEAR THAT MR. COCHRAN KNOWS WHAT THE TERM
MEANS AND HAS HEARD IT BEFORE SO WE WON'T NEED EXPERT TESTIMONY ON THIS
ISSUE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I DON'T THINK THE COURT DOES EITHER.

*THE COURT:* I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE HACKER BOOK. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. MR.
DARDEN, GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR FLOOD PROBLEMS. COUNSEL, WHY DON'T WE TAKE A
BRIEF RECESS AND THEN WE WILL HEAR THE RESPONSE.

*MR. GORDON:* THANK YOU.

(RECESS.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY:)

*MR. GORDON:* MAY WE APPROACH, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* SURE.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

*THE COURT:* BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. ALL PARTIES ARE
AGAIN PRESENT. AND, MR. GORDON, YOU HAD ONE COMMENT BEFORE YOU SUBMIT
THE ARGUMENT?

*MR. GORDON:* YES, YOUR HONOR. BEFORE WE SUBMIT -- WE HAVE DISCUSSED IT
AT SIDEBAR -- WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE COURT THE FURTHER -- THE
DOCUMENTS WITH REGARDS TO OUR OFFER OF PROOF. WE ARE GOING TO INDEX BY
INCIDENTS THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS. WE WILL HAVE A COPY FOR YOU IN THE
MORNING AND FOR DEFENSE FOR THEIR INSPECTION AS PART OF OUR OFFER OF PROOF.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU. MR. UELMEN, DO YOU WISH TO RESPOND?

*MR. UELMEN:* YES, YOUR HONOR. LET ME LEAD OFF BY ASSURING THE COURT
THAT WE ARE NOT WITHDRAWING THE ARGUMENT MADE IN OUR BRIEF THAT THE
ADMISSION OF THIS EVIDENCE WOULD ALSO BE A VIOLATION OF THE DEFENDANT'S
DUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS. AND
WE CITE A CASE WHICH I THINK IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE, THE CASE OF MC
KINNEY VERSUS REESE, IN WHICH THE 9TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS RECENTLY
GRANTED A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS TO A CALIFORNIA DEFENDANT WHO HAD BEEN
CONVICTED ON THE BASIS OF THE ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE OF PRIOR ACTS; AND
THE COURT HELD THAT WAS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL DUE PROCESS RIGHTS THAT
REQUIRED THE GRANT OF A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS. SO THIS IS NOT A GROUNDS
THAT WE ARE WITHDRAWING FROM CONSIDERATION OF THE COURT. LET ME BACK UP
TO THE BEGINNING, THE THEORY THAT THERE IS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR
RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES THAT ALLOWS THE COURT TO ADMIT EVIDENCE OF
PRIOR ACTS OF MISCONDUCT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE EXCEPTIONS CONTAINED
IN SECTION 1101(B). TO SUPPORT THAT ARGUMENT, WE HEARD FROM THE
PROSECUTION A NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS. FIRST OF ALL, WE HEARD THAT THIS IS
SIMPLE COMMON SENSE, THAT WHEN SOMEONE KILLS SOMEONE WITH WHOM THEY ARE
IN A RELATIONSHIP, THE FIRST QUESTION THAT SHOULD OCCUR TO US IS WHAT
WAS GOING ON, AND ONLY WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE
RELATIONSHIP DOES THE KILLING MAKE SENSE. THERE'S ALSO ONE PROBLEM WITH
THAT; AND THAT IS, THESE QUESTIONS ARISE ONLY WHEN YOU ASSUME THAT THE
DEFENDANT IS THE PERSON WHO DID THE KILLING. IT'S A KIND OF A WORKING
BACKWARDS KIND OF ARGUMENT. WE'RE ASSUMING THAT THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS
KILLING WAS A PERSON IN RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM. SO LET'S GO BACK
AND TAKE APART THAT RELATIONSHIP AND LOOK AT EVERY ASPECT OF IT. BUT
THAT COMMON SENSE DOESN'T HELP US VERY MUCH OR GET US VERY FAR IF WE'RE
DEALING WITH A CASE WHERE THE ISSUE TO BE LITIGATED IS, WHO DID THIS
KILLING. WE'RE NOT ASSUMING THAT IT WAS ANYONE IN RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
VICTIM. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANY, MANY OF THE CASES
THAT HAVE BEEN CITED BY THE PROSECUTION THROUGHOUT THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE
CASES WHERE THE IDENTITY OF THE KILLER WAS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE. WHAT WAS
REALLY BEING LITIGATED WAS, WAS THAT A SELF-DEFENSE SITUATION, WAS THE
KILLER ACTING IN THE HEAT OF PASSION, WAS THIS AN ACCIDENT, DID THE GUN
ACCIDENTALLY GO OFF, WAS THERE DEMENTED CAPACITY, SOME FORM OF ABUSE
EXCUSE? AND I WANT TO ASSURE THE COURT AT THE OUTSET HERE AND NOW, AND
ALL OF THE DEFENSE LAWYERS AGREE IN THIS STATEMENT, THIS IS A MURDER
CASE PERIOD. THE DEFENSE IS NOT GOING TO PRESENT ANY DEFENSE WITH
RESPECT TO HEAT OF PASSION. THE DEFENDANT WILL NOT BE SEEKING AN
INSTRUCTION ON VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. WE WANT THIS CASE SUBMITTED TO
THE JURY AS A MURDER CASE; AND THEY WILL HAVE TO COME BACK WITH A
VERDICT OF GUILTY OF MURDER OR NOT GUILTY OF MURDER, MR. O.J. SIMPSON.
SO THE ONLY ISSUE REALLY THAT IS GOING TO BE IN CONTENTION IN THIS TRIAL
IS WHETHER MR. O.J. SIMPSON IS THE PERSON WHO PERPETRATED THIS HOMICIDE.
AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE OF PRIOR
CHARACTER OF THE CHARACTER OF MR. SIMPSON BE LOOKED FROM THAT
PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO BE IN CONTENTION IN THE COURSE OF
THESE PROCEEDINGS. NOW, TO SUPPORT THIS THEORY OF A RELATIONSHIP
VIOLENCE EXCEPTION, THE PROSECUTION HAS TOLD US, "WELL, ZACK ISN'T THE
ONLY CASE THAT HAS EVER SAID THIS. WE'VE PRESENTED 10 CASES IN WHICH
COURTS HAVE MADE STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EVIDENCE COMING IN TO SHOW
THE NATURE OF A RELATIONSHIP IN A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE." WELL, I
LOOKED AT THOSE 10 CASES. I CERTAINLY LOOKED AT THEM MUCH MORE CAREFULLY
THAN I HAD BEFORE THE ARGUMENT WAS PRESENTED HERE IN COURT AND
DISCOVERED THAT SEVEN OF THE 10 CASES PRECEDED THE ENACTMENT OF THE
CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE. AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE
OF COURSE, OUR CONTENTION IS THAT THIS SO-CALLED EXCEPTION FOR
RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THE CALIFORNIA
EVIDENCE CODE WHICH DEFINES FOR THIS CASE WHAT EVIDENCE WILL BE ADMITTED
AND WON'T BE ADMITTED. ONLY THREE OF THE 10 CASES WERE ACTUALLY DECIDED
UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE AND CONSTRUED THE PROVISIONS OF
1101(A) AND 1101(B), AND THOSE ARE THE THREE CASES THAT ARE CITED ON
PAGE 32 OF THE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE TO THE MOTION IN LIMINE. ALL THREE OF
THESE CASES INCIDENTALLY HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO IN THE COURSE OF THE ORAL
ARGUMENT PRESENTED BY THE PEOPLE, AND I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO TAKE A
LOOK AT THESE CASES AND SEE WHAT WAS REALLY AT ISSUE, WHAT WAS BEING
CONTENDED IN THE TRIALS AND HOW MUCH SIMILARITY WAS THERE BETWEEN THE
PRIOR ACTS THAT WERE BEING ADMITTED OSTENSIBLY TO EXPLAIN THIS
RELATIONSHIP AND THE ACTUAL OFFENSE FOR WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS ON
TRIAL. THE FIRST OF THESE CASES IS PEOPLE VERSUS HELFEND, A 1969 CASE,
IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS ACCUSED OF MURDERING HIS FORMER WIFE'S
HUSBAND. THE DEFENDANT WAS ARRESTED WHILE DRIVING AN AUTOMOBILE ACROSS
THE MEXICAN BORDER IN WHICH THE BODY OF THE VICTIM, HIS FORMER WIFE'S
HUSBAND, WAS IN THE TRUNK OF THE AUTOMOBILE, NOT A CASE IN WHICH THE
IDENTITY OF THE KILLER WAS BEING CLOSELY CONTESTED. IN FACT, THE DEFENSE
THAT HE PRESENTED IN THAT CASE WAS SELF-DEFENSE, THAT HE HAD KILLED THIS
MAN IN SELF-DEFENSE. AND IT WAS IN THAT CONTEXT THAT THE COURT ADMITTED
EVIDENCE THAT ON A PRIOR OCCASION, HE HAD HIRED SOMEONE OR ATTEMPTED TO
HIRE SOMEONE TO BEAT UP THIS SAME VICTIM AND HE HAD ALSO BURNED DOWN
THIS VICTIM'S HOUSE. NOW, THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PROCESS OF EVIDENTIARY
INFERENCE THAN THE COURT IS BEING ASKED TO ENGAGE IN THIS CASE. WE'RE
NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT EXPLAINING A RELATIONSHIP. WE ARE PRESENTING VERY
SIMILAR ACTS THAT GO DIRECTLY TO COUNTERING THE DEFENDANT'S CLAIM THAT
THE MURDER WAS A SELF-DEFENSE KILLING. THE SECOND CASE IS PEOPLE VERSUS
DANIELS. THIS IS THE CASE IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING
HIS WIFE BY EXPLODING A CAN BOMB IN THE AUTOMOBILE IN WHICH SHE WAS
SEATED. AND THE PRIOR MISCONDUCT THAT WAS ADMITTED OSTENSIBLY TO EXPLAIN
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS THAT WITHIN THE ONE YEAR PRIOR TO THE CAR BOMB
GOING OFF, HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO ASSAULT HER WITH A KNIFE, HE HAD HELD A
GUN TO HER HEAD AND HE HAD DRIVEN A CAR OFF A CLIFF AND JUMPED OUT OF
THE CAR SO THAT SHE WOULD GO OVER THE CLIFF IN THE CAR. AND FORTUNATELY,
THE CAR RAN INTO A TREE, FORTUNATELY FOR HER. IT DELAYED HER DEATH BY
ABOUT SIX MONTHS. NOW, THAT'S NOT EVIDENCE TO SIMPLY EXPLAIN A
RELATIONSHIP. THAT IS STRONG EVIDENCE OF A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR SHOWING
THAT HIS GOAL WAS TO KILL HIS WIFE AND HE HAD FAILED ON THREE PRIOR
ATTEMPTS BEFORE HE FINALLY SUCCEEDED. THE THIRD CASE IS PEOPLE VERSUS
HAYLOCK INVOLVING A FEMALE DEFENDANT WHO WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING HER
EX-BOYFRIEND. THE KILLING WAS COMMITTED IN AUGUST OF 1979 IN THE
PRESENCE OF AN EYEWITNESS, THE EYEWITNESS BEING THE VICTIM'S MOTHER. AND
SHE REPORTED THAT THE DEFENDANT ATTACKED THE VICTIM WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE
SAYING, "YOU SON OF A BITCH. THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED," AND THEN STABBED
HIM WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE. WELL, THE PRIOR INCIDENTS THAT WERE ADMITTED
TO EXPLAIN THIS RELATIONSHIP WERE THAT NINE MONTHS BEFORE, IN DECEMBER
OF 1978, SHE ATTACKED THE VICTIM WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE, AND ON FEBRUARY
OR IN FEBRUARY OF 1979, SIX MONTHS BEFORE THIS INCIDENT, SHE AGAIN
ATTACKED HIM WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE. NOW, WHAT WE SEE IN THESE CASES ARE
SIMPLY CLASSIC EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE PRIOR
INCIDENTS AND THE INCIDENT ON TRIAL THAT IS GOING TO ASSIST THE JURY IN
TERMS OF RESOLVING AN ISSUE BEING CONTENDED IN THESE CASES AS TO WHETHER
IT WAS AN INTENTIONAL KILLING SHOWING THE IDENTITY OF THE KILLINGS BY
SIGNATURE KIND OF FACTS, THE CLASSIC APPLICATION OF THE 1101(B)
EXCEPTIONS. THESE ARE FAR FROM ANY EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE COURT OR WHAT THE
PROSECUTION SAYS ZACK STANDS FOR; THAT WHENEVER YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
CASE, YOU CAN BRING IN EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP IN
TERMS OF PRIOR ACTS OF MISCONDUCT. NOW, WITH RESPECT TO ZACK ITSELF, I
KNOW THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT ZACK REALLY STANDS FOR,
IF ANYTHING. ALL WE CAN SAY IS THAT IN OUR READING OF THE CASE AS SIMPLY
AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE CALL THE THIRD EXCEPTION, THAT IS WHERE THE
DEFENDANT TAKES THE STAND AND PRESENTS HIS RELATIONSHIP AS A POSITIVE
LOVING ONE, THAT THE PEOPLE CAN COUNTER THAT WITH EVIDENCE JUST AS THEY
CAN WITH ANY OTHER WITNESS TO SHOW THAT THIS ISN'T TRUE. AND THAT OF
COURSE WOULD NOT ARISE UNLESS THAT WAS DONE IN THIS CASE IN TERMS OF
EVIDENCE BEING PRESENTED BY THE DEFENDANT. ALL I CAN SAY IS, OUR READING
OF ZACK PUTS US IN VERY GOOD COMPANY BECAUSE THAT IS PRECISELY HOW THE
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT READ ZACK. THE ONLY CASE THAT ANYONE CAN FIND
IN WHICH THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS EVER CITED ZACK IS THE CASE OF
PEOPLE VERSUS ALLISON. AND WE INVITE THE COURT'S ATTENTION TO THE
FOOTNOTE IN ALLISON, WHERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY. ZACK STANDS
FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT A DEFENDANT WHO TESTIFIES CAN BE IMPEACHED WITH
EVIDENCE OF PRIOR INCIDENTS OF MISCONDUCT. AND FINALLY, THE PEOPLE RELY
ON THE HASTON CASE AS REALLY AN EXAMPLE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP CONCEPT,
THAT SOMEHOW HASTON REINFORCES THIS THEORY BECAUSE IN HASTON, THE PRIOR
ACTS THAT WERE ADMITTED WERE ACTS COMMITTED WITH THE SAME CONFEDERATE,
AND BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT HAD COMMITTED TWO PRIOR ROBBERIES WITH THE
SAME CONFEDERATE, THE JURY COULD DRAW AN INFERENCE THAT SINCE HE WAS
CHARGED IN THIS CASE WITH COMMITTING A ROBBERY WITH THE SAME
CONFEDERATE, THAT THIS IS A PATTERN OF CONDUCT THAT ASSISTED IN
IDENTIFYING HIM AS THE PERPETRATOR. SO THE SIGNATURE REALLY WAS THE
PRESENCE OF THAT CONFEDERATE. THAT REALLY ISN'T A RELATIONSHIP CASE AT
ALL. IN FACT, THAT CASE MIGHT BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE TO THE PROSECUTION
IF THEY HAD EVIDENCE THAT ON TWO PRIOR OCCASIONS, MR. SIMPSON HAD
ENCOUNTERED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WITH RONALD GOLDMAN, AND ON BOTH OF
THOSE OCCASIONS, MR. SIMPSON REACTED IN SOME SORT OF VIOLENT WAY BY
ASSAULTING HIS WIFE OR ASSAULTING MR. GOLDMAN. THEN WE MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHETHER THOSE INCIDENTS EXPLAIN WHAT
HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE 12TH, 1994 WHEN THE PROSECUTION IS GOING
TO THEORIZE THAT A THIRD SUCH CONFRONTATION TOOK PLACE. BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE HAVE HERE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY SIMILAR FACTS ON WHICH WE CAN HANG
ANY SORT OF INFERENCE THAT THIS CRIME ON JUNE 12TH WAS DONE WITH A
PARTICULAR INTENT, WITH A PARTICULAR MOTIVE OR WAS DONE BY A PARTICULAR
PERSON. NOW, WHEN WE GET TO THE TRADITIONAL 1101(B) EXCEPTIONS, IT
OCCURRED TO ME AGAIN THE PROSECUTION MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.
THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL THEORY IF THEY COULD SHOW THAT WHEN THE POLICE
ARRIVED AT THE BUNDY PREMISES ON THE -- EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE
13TH, 1994, THEY FOUND TWO DEAD BODIES AND THEY FOUND A LOT OF BROKEN
PICTURE FRAMES WITH FAMILY PICTURES. WOULDN'T WE HAVE A STUNNING
SIGNATURE KIND OF CASE IN WHICH WE COULD GO BACK TO PRIOR INCIDENTS OF
BROKEN FAMILY PICTURES AND SAY, "LOOK, LOOK AT WHAT WAS DONE HERE, AND
WE CAN INFER THAT THE SAME THING WAS GOING ON ON JUNE 12TH"? AND THAT
REALLY IS WHAT 1101(B) IS ALL ABOUT, WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE KIND OF SIMILAR
FACTS. BUT HERE, THERE'S NO SUCH EVIDENCE. HERE, THE ONLY ISSUE WE WANT
TO LITIGATE IS WHO WAS THERE JUNE 12TH AND COMMITTED THESE HOMICIDES.
AND WE'RE SAYING WE'RE READY AND WILLING TO LITIGATE THAT ISSUE ON THE
BASIS OF WHAT YOU DID FIND ON THE SIDEWALK. IN FACT, WE'RE WITHDRAWING
OUR OBJECTIONS AND LETTING ALL OF THAT EVIDENCE COME IN BECAUSE THAT IS
THE EVIDENCE THE JURY SHOULD LOOK AT IN TERMS OF DECIDING THIS CASE IN
WHICH THE ONLY REAL ISSUE IS WHO COMMITTED THESE KILLINGS. NOW, THE
TREASURE TROVE CASE OF EWOLDT, I FOUND IT AMUSING THAT A CALIFORNIA
SUPREME COURT OPINION WITHIN THE LAST YEAR HAS SOMEHOW BEEN APPROPRIATED
AS A SECRET TREASURE TROVE OF THE PROSECUTION. THE REASON WE POINTED THE
COURT'S ATTENTION TO EWOLDT WAS BECAUSE IT IS THE LAST WORD FROM THE
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WITH RESPECT TO THE MEANING OF THE 1101(B)
EXCEPTIONS. AND THE GUIDING PRINCIPAL THAT THE COURT SETS FORTH IN
EWOLDT IS THAT PRINCIPAL OF SIMILARITY. AND THEY HAVE SIMPLY LAID OUT AN
ATTEMPT TO QUANTIFY HOW MUCH SIMILARITY YOU NEED FOR EACH OF THE VARIOUS
THEORIES THAT YOU ARE PURSUING. AND THEY POINT OUT FIRST OF ALL THAT
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOTIVE OR INTENT AS THE THEORY, THAT UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ORDINARILY, THE IDENTITY HAS BEEN ASSUMED. WE KNOW
WHO DID IT AND WE'RE LOOKING AT WHY THEY DID IT OR WHAT INTENT THEY DID
IT WITH. AND IF OUR REAL PURPOSE IS TO SHOW IDENTITY, TO SHOW THAT THE
SAME PERPETRATOR DID THESE PRIOR ACTS AND DID THE ACT FOR WHICH HE IS
NOW ON TRIAL, WE HAVE THE STRONGEST NEED FOR SIMILARITY, THAT THE
SIMILARITY MUST RISE TO THE LEVEL OF SIGNATURE FACTS.

NOW, EWOLDT WAS NEITHER. EWOLDT WAS A SITUATION THE COURT DEFINED AS
KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE IN TERMS OF COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN. BUT EVEN IN
TERMS OF SHOWING A SERIES OF ACTS WITH A COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN, THE
COURT INSISTED ON A GOOD DEAL OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE ACTS BEFORE WE
COULD INFER THAT THEY WERE PART OF A COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN. AND I THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK IN EWOLDT AT HOW MUCH SIMILARITY THERE ACTUALLY
WAS BETWEEN THE PRIOR ACTS OF ABUSE OF A STEP CHILD AND THE CURRENT ACT
OF ABUSE OF A STEP CHILD FOR WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS ON TRIAL. THE COURT
SAID IN THE PRESENT CASE:

"THE VICTIMS OF BOTH THE UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT AND THE CHARGED OFFENSES
WERE THE DEFENDANT'S STEPDAUGHTERS WHO WERE RESIDING IN THE DEFENDANT'S
HOME AND THE ACTS OCCURRED WHEN THE VICTIMS WERE OF A SIMILAR AGE.

"ON THREE OCCASIONS, THE DEFENDANT MOLESTED NATALIE AT NIGHT WHILE SHE
WAS ASLEEP IN HER BED. AND WHEN HE WAS DISCOVERED, THE DEFENDANT
ASSERTED HE WAS ONLY STRAIGHTENING UP THE COVERS." NATALIE WAS THE
VICTIM OF THE PRIOR UNCHARGED OFFENSES.

"IN TWO OF THE CHARGED OFFENSES, THE DEFENDANT MOLESTED JENNIFER IN AN
ALMOST IDENTICAL FASHION COMING INTO HER BEDROOM MOLESTING HER, AND THEN
WHEN SHE AWOKE, OFFERING THE EXCUSE THAT HE WAS FIXING THE COVERS." SO
SIGNATURE FACTS AGAIN, VERY CLOSE FACTUAL SIMILARITY FROM WHICH WE CAN
DRAW AN INFERENCE THAT THESE ACTS WERE PART OF A COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN.
WE HAVE NO SUCH SIMILARITIES IN THIS CASE. AGAIN AND AGAIN, WE HAVE
CHALLENGED THE PEOPLE TO SHOW US WHERE ARE THE SIMILARITIES. WHERE IS
THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN A FIGHT ON NEW YEAR'S EVE WHERE BOTH PARTIES HAVE
BEEN DRINKING, AT LEAST SOME SLAPPING AND WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT SIDEWALK
ON JUNE 12TH, 1994? WHERE IS THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN PEOPLE ARGUING ABOUT
WHETHER SOMEBODY HAS HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK AND WHO SHOULD DRIVE CARS
BACK FROM A RESTAURANT AND WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT SIDEWALK ON JUNE 12TH,
1994? THERE'S JUST NO SIMILARITY HERE. FINALLY, WITH RESPECT TO THE
1101(B) EXCEPTION, WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF 352. THAT IS,
ASSUMING WE FIND ENOUGH SIMILARITY TO SAY 1101(B) APPLIES, WE STILL HAVE
TO LOOK UNDER 352 AT WHETHER THE DANGER OF SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF
CONFUSING THE JURY OF UNDUE CONSUMPTION OF TIME, OF MISLEADING THE JURY
OUTWEIGHS WHATEVER PROBATIVE VALUE THIS EVIDENCE MIGHT HAVE. AND HERE,
YOUR HONOR, I CAN NOT STRESS TOO MUCH THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING AT THE
PURPOSE FOR WHICH THIS EVIDENCE WILL BE USED IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE
POTENTIAL PREJUDICIAL IMPACT. I MEAN IF WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE TRIAL
WHERE THE ONLY ISSUE REALLY IN CONTENTION IS, DID MR. SIMPSON DO IT, AND
THE PEOPLE COME IN SAYING, "WELL, WE WANT TO OFFER THIS TO EXPLAIN A
RELATIONSHIP, WE WANT TO OFFER THIS TO SUGGEST A MOTIVE RELATED TO
ESTRANGEMENT," WE HAVE TO ASSESS WHETHER A JURY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO
LIMIT THEIR CONSIDERATION OF THEIR EVIDENCE TO JUST THAT ISSUE OR
WHETHER IN FACT THEY WON'T REALLY USE IT AS EVIDENCE OF IDENTITY AND USE
IT AS EVIDENCE OF IDENTITY WITHOUT THE REQUISITE SIGNATURE FACTS THAT
ARE DEMANDED BY THE LAW. THAT IS THE REAL RISK OF PREJUDICE THAT WE FACE
IN THIS CASE. AND I THINK THAT THE RISK IS A VERY, VERY SUBSTANTIAL ONE
WITH RESPECT TO MUCH OF THIS EVIDENCE; THAT THERE IS GREAT DANGER THAT
IT WOULD BE MISUSED BY THE JURY, THAT THE JURY WOULD BE MISLED AND
CONFUSED BY IT. WITH RESPECT TO WHAT KIND OF PREJUDICE MIGHT ENSUE, I
FOUND A VERY INTERESTING CONTRAST BETWEEN MR. GOLDBERG'S ARGUMENT
SAYING, "WELL, IT'S REALLY SILLY TO BELIEVE THAT A JURY WOULD ACTUALLY
LOOK AT THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS OF ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR AND SAY, 'WELL,
BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT HADN'T BEEN CONVICTED OF THOSE ASSAULTIVE
BEHAVIORS, WE'RE GOING TO CONVICT HIM NOW OF A DOUBLE MURDER,'" THAT
THAT SOMEHOW KIND OF PREJUDICE OCCURRING IN A TRIAL WAS BEYOND BELIEF.
AND THEN MR. GORDON GOT UP AND MR. GORDON SAID, "YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE
HERE. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF A FAILURE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM LET NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON DOWN." I DON'T
THINK WE COULD HAVE A BETTER EXAMPLE OF THE PREJUDICIAL IMPACT THIS KIND
OF EVIDENCE CAN HAVE TO SAY TO A JURY, "WE LET THIS VICTIM DOWN, BUT NOW
WE CAN MAKE UP FOR IT BY CONVICTING THIS MAN OF MURDER BECAUSE HE WASN'T
CONVICTED. HE WASN'T BROUGHT TO JUSTICE FOR ALL OF THIS PRIOR ASSAULTIVE
BEHAVIOR," AND THAT IS A TRUE SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF PREJUDICE IN THIS
CASE. THE OTHER ASPECT OF 352 THAT WAS DISCUSSED WAS THE QUESTION OF
UNDUE CONSUMPTION OF TIME, THAT SOMEHOW THE DEFENSE WAS IN A POSTURE
HERE OF BLACKMAILING THE COURT IN SAYING, "WELL, IF WE HAVE TO LITIGATE
ALL OF THE NUANCES OF ALL OF THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS, WE'RE GOING TO BE
STUCK IN THIS TRIAL FOR A VERY LONG TIME LITIGATING A LOT OF ISSUES OF
VERY LIMITED RELEVANCE." I FIND IT CURIOUS TO SUGGEST THAT THAT IS SOME
SORT OF BLACKMAIL BY THE DEFENSE WHEN THE DEFENSE IS ONLY PUT IN THAT
POSITION AFTER THE PROSECUTION USES A TABLOID BOOK AS KIND OF A SLUDGE
DREDGE TO LOOK THROUGH A 17-YEAR RELATIONSHIP AND COME UP WITH EVERY
CONCEIVABLE WITNESS, MANY OF WHOM THEY NOW RECOGNIZE ARE OF HIGHLY
QUESTIONABLE CREDIBILITY AND TO BRING THAT ALL IN AND SAY, "WE WANT TO
OFFER THIS IN EVIDENCE IN THIS TRIAL AND TO KEEP EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF
THIS CASE FAR BEYOND THE QUESTION WITH WHICH MR. SIMPSON WAS CONFRONTED
BY THE CHARGES THAT WERE FILED AGAINST HIM LAST JUNE OF WHETHER IN FACT
HE COMMITTED THIS MURDER." NOW, LET ME ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF THE WHOLE
ISSUE OF BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THIS TRIAL.
WE'RE TOLD THAT WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF THE BATTERED
WOMEN'S SYNDROME AND UNBROKEN PATTERN OF ESCALATING VIOLENCE CULMINATING
IN A MURDER JUNE 12TH, 1994. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS WHEEL OF THE
BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME, I THINK WE RECOGNIZE IMMEDIATELY THAT THERE
ARE A LOT OF SPOKES MISSING FROM THIS WHEEL. THERE ARE A LOT OF
EXCEPTIONS TO WHAT IS CALLED THE TEXTBOOK PATTERN OF THE BATTERED
WOMEN'S SYNDROME. FOR EXAMPLE, NONE OF THE INCIDENTS OR THE EVIDENCE
PRESENTED TO THE COURT IN THE COURSE OF THIS HEARING SUGGESTS ANY USE OF
ECONOMIC ABUSE BY THE DEFENDANT IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE VICTIM IN THIS
CASE. AND I CAN MAKE A BRIEF OFFER OF PROOF. WE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE IN
THIS CASE WILL SHOW QUITE TO THE CONTRARY; THAT FROM THE BEGINNING OF
THEIR RELATIONSHIP, MR. SIMPSON ENCOURAGED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON TO BE
ECONOMICALLY INDEPENDENT. HE ENCOURAGED HER TO START HER OWN BUSINESS,
TO BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT. HE RECOMMENDED HER TO MANY FRIENDS IN TERMS
OF HER INTERIOR DECORATING ABILITIES. AT ALL TIMES THROUGHOUT THEIR
MARRIAGE, THEY MAINTAINED SEPARATE CHECKING ACCOUNTS. SO MRS. SIMPSON
NEVER HAD TO ASK PERMISSION TO WRITE A CHECK. SHE HAD HER OWN CREDIT
CARD ACCOUNTS. WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED, MR. SIMPSON MADE A GIFT TO MRS.
SIMPSON OF A CONDO WORTH $500,000 WHICH BROUGHT HER A MONTHLY INCOME OF
ABOUT $3,000 WHICH -- FOR WHICH SHE WAS TOTALLY NOT DEPENDENT ON MR.
SIMPSON. HE PURCHASED FOR HER A FERRARI AUTOMOBILE, A MERCEDES AND A
PORSCHE AUTOMOBILE AND ALL OF THOSE AUTOMOBILES WERE PUT IN HER OWN
NAME. SHE WAS GIVEN COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THOSE VEHICLES. NOW, THERE WAS
A BRIEF SUGGESTION THAT BECAUSE MR. SIMPSON AT SOME POINT COMPLAINED I
BELIEVE IT WAS TO ONE OF A MEMBER OF MRS. SIMPSON'S FAMILY THAT HE WAS
PAYING FOR THE DINNERS FOR HER BOYFRIENDS, IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THIS
WAS SOME SORT OF ATTEMPT TO EXERT ECONOMIC CONTROL. AND THE EVIDENCE
WILL SHOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WAS, DURING THE PENDENCY OF THEIR
DIVORCE, WHILE MR. SIMPSON WAS PAYING $25,000 A MONTH IN TEMPORARY
SUPPORT, MRS. SIMPSON TOOK KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH TO DINNER AT A GOLF CLUB IN
LAGUNA AND CHARGED IT TO MR. SIMPSON'S ACCOUNT. NOW, IS THAT ECONOMIC
BLACKMAIL? IS THAT AN ATTEMPT TO EXERT CONTROL WHEN HE PROTESTS THAT
THAT KIND OF ENTERTAINMENT IS STILL BEING BILLED TO HIM AT A TIME WHEN
HE IS ALREADY PAYING SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TEMPORARY SUPPORT? THE
SUGGESTION CONCERNING THIS TAX FRAUD INVESTIGATION, THAT THAT IS SOME
SORT OF INTIMIDATION I THINK HAS BEEN FULLY EXPLAINED. AND IF YOUR HONOR
LOOKS AT THE LETTER THAT WAS WRITTEN AND SEES THAT THE ONLY POINT BEING
MADE IS THAT MR. SIMPSON CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN A FRAUD ON THE GOVERNMENT
BY HAVING MRS. SIMPSON CLAIM THAT HER PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE IS HIS HOME,
THAT'S THE ONLY POINT THE LETTER MAKES. IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO COERCE
HER IN ANY WAY OR THREATEN HER OR EXERT CONTROL OVER HER. SO THAT SPOKE
IS TOTALLY MISSING FROM THIS PICTURE OF ANY SORT OF ECONOMIC ABUSE.
LIKEWISE MISSING IS ANY SUGGESTION THAT MR. SIMPSON EVER USED THE
CHILDREN AS A MEANS OF CONTROL OVER HIS WIFE OR HIS FORMER WIFE. IN
FACT, ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT HE WAS
COMPLIMENTARY OF HER ABILITY AS A MOTHER AND VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE
DECISIONS SHE WAS MAKING WITH RESPECT TO THE RAISING OF THE CHILDREN.
THE ONLY TIME THE CHILDREN EVER CAME UP IN ANY OF ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS
THAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH ITEM BY ITEM WAS WITH RESPECT TO THE
ZLOMSOWITCH INCIDENT WHEN MR. SIMPSON RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT SEXUAL
ACTIVITY TAKING PLACE IN HIS HOME WHILE HIS CHILDREN WERE PRESENT AND
COULD POSSIBLY ACCIDENTALLY INTERRUPT OR OBSERVE THAT ACTIVITY GOING ON.
THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW AN AUDIT TRAIL CONFIRMS THE PRESENCE OF A
BATTERING RELATIONSHIP SUGGESTS THAT THE ONLY MOTIVATION FOR MRS.
SIMPSON TO MAINTAIN EVIDENCE OF ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR IN A SAFETY DEPOSIT
BOX WAS FOR SOME POTENTIAL CRIMINAL CONSEQUENCES OF ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.
BUT THE FACTS WILL SHOW THAT ALL OF THIS TOOK PLACE IN THE WAKE OF THE
1989 INCIDENT, THAT PART OF THE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO AS A RESULT OF
THAT INCIDENT WAS MR. SIMPSON AGREEING THAT IF HE EVER STRUCK OR LAID A
HAND ON MRS. SIMPSON AGAIN, THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT WOULD BE VOIDABLE,
AND THAT IT MIGHT SUGGEST A MOTIVE WHY AN AUDIT TRAIL WOULD BE
MAINTAINED IN THIS CASE IN CASE MRS. SIMPSON EVER WANTED TO TRY TO
EXERCISE THAT OPTION. AND I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT NEVER ONCE WAS
THAT OPTION EXERCISED EVEN IN THE COURSE OF A CONTENTIOUS DIVORCE
PROCEEDING THREE YEARS LATER. IN THE COURSE OF THAT DIVORCE PROCEEDING,
IN A DEPOSITION, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW MRS. SIMPSON STATED UNDER OATH
THAT SINCE THE 1989 INCIDENT, THAT O.J. SIMPSON HAD NEVER LAID A HAND ON
HER. NOW, WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST IN TERMS OF A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF
BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME? WHAT IT SUGGESTS TO ME IS THAT INTERVENTION
WORKED; THAT IN THE WAKE OF THAT INCIDENT, WHEN MR. SIMPSON WENT TO
COURT, PLED NO CONTEST, WAS GIVEN AS A CONDITION OF PROBATION THAT HE
UNDERGO COUNSELING, THAT THAT COUNSELING WAS ACTUALLY QUITE SUCCESSFUL.
THE PHYSICAL ABUSE CAME TO AN ABRUPT HALT. THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE IN ANY
INCIDENT THEREAFTER. I MEAN EVEN LOOKING AT ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS
DREDGED UP BY THE PROSECUTION. AND I THINK WE CAN REST ASSURED THAT THEY
HAVE DONE A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION OF ANY INCIDENT OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.
THE ONLY INCIDENT AFTER 1989, AFTER JANUARY 1ST WAS THE ALLEGED INCIDENT
INVOLVING THE AUTOMOBILE AND THE PUSHING AND SHOVING OF WHO WAS GOING TO
GET IN WHAT AUTOMOBILE. AND APPARENTLY WHILE ONE WITNESS TO THAT
INCIDENT CLAIMS THAT IT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF PHYSICAL ABUSE, IT WAS NOT
CONSTRUED AS SUCH BY NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, BECAUSE IN HER DEPOSITION,
SHE SAID SINCE THE 1989 INCIDENT, O.J. HAD NOT LAID A HAND ON HER. AND
THAT'S THE ONLY ALLEGATION. OF COURSE, THERE ARE FIVE OTHER WITNESSES TO
THAT INCIDENT WHO MAY GIVE A VERY DIFFERENT VERSION. BUT WE HAVE
ACTUALLY NOT ONE SINGLE BIT OF EVIDENCE OF ANY PHYSICAL ASSAULTIVE
BEHAVIOR OR ABUSE TOWARD THE VICTIM AFTER JANUARY 1ST, 1989 WHEN THAT
INTERVENTION TOOK PLACE.

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS WHEEL OF THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME IS THAT IT
IS A WHEEL, AND WHEELS CAN SPIN, AND THIS WHEEL CAN PUT A SPIN ON
EVERYTHING THAT MR. SIMPSON DOES OVER THE COURSE OF A 17-YEAR
RELATIONSHIP. IF HE BRINGS FLOWERS TO THE DOORSTEP, HE'S CONTROLLING. IF
HE APOLOGIZES, HE'S MINIMIZING. IF HE CRITICIZES HIS WIFE FOR SEXUAL
ESCAPADES IN THE VIEW OF PASSERSBY, HE'S HUMILIATING HER. IF HE BREAKS
HER FAMILY PICTURES, HE'S DEMEANING HER. IF HE BREAKS HIS FAMILY
PICTURES, WE ASSUME HE'S ACTING LIKE THE MASTER OF THE CASTLE. SO IT'S A
SPINNING WHEEL THAT CAN PUT A SPIN ON ALL OF THIS BEHAVIOR. AND THIS IS
NOT TO MINIMIZE SPOUSAL ABUSE. WE DON'T INTEND TO MINIMIZE IT AT ALL.
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR. BUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY LEFT WITH
IN THIS CASE IS A RECORD OF OCCASIONAL LAPSES IN THE COURSE OF A 17-YEAR
RELATIONSHIP THAT DON'T EVEN FIT THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE
BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME IS. BUT EVEN IF IT DID, THE QUESTION THAT THIS
COURT REALLY FACES IS WHAT WOULD THAT PROVE? WOULD THAT PROVE THAT MR.
SIMPSON IS THE PERPETRATOR OF A MURDER BECAUSE HE WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF
ABUSE IN A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP? AND EVEN THE EXPERT PRESENTED BY THE
PEOPLE WOULD NOT VENTURE OUT ON TO THAT LIMB, WOULD NOT SAY THAT BASED
ON THE EARMARKS OF THE BATTERING WOMEN'S SYNDROME, WE CAN MAKE ANY SORT
OF PREDICTION AS TO WHETHER THE BATTERER IN THAT RELATIONSHIP IS LIKELY
TO BE THE PERPETRATOR OF A HOMICIDE. AND THE REASON HE WOULDN'T VENTURE
OUT ON TO THAT LIMB IS BECAUSE HE WAS QUITE HONEST AND FRANK IN
ADMITTING THAT THAT'S REALLY NOT THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH THAT HAS
BEEN DONE WITH RESPECT TO THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME. THE REAL
PURPOSE IS TO EXPLAIN THE CONDUCT OF THE VICTIMS. AND WHEN THE STATE
LEGISLATURE INDICATED THAT UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, EVIDENCE OF THE
BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME WILL BE ADMISSIBLE IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL, THEY
DELINEATED WHAT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE, WHERE IT MIGHT BE RELEVANT
TO PROVE THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIM. AND THE REFERENCE TO THE
POSSIBLE USE OF THAT EVIDENCE BY THE PROSECUTION WAS EXPLAINED IN THE
LEGISLATIVE REPORTS AS WHERE IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN WHY A
VICTIM REFUSES TO CORROBORATE OR RECANTS OR WON'T TESTIFY AGAINST THE
BATTERER AND THE PROSECUTION WANTS TO CARRY ON THE PROSECUTION OF THE
BATTERER. UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, BRINGING IN EVIDENCE OF THE
BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME WILL EXPLAIN THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIM,
BUT IT CAN'T BE USED AS EVIDENCE TO SHOW IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT THE
BATTERER DID THE ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR WITH WHICH HE IS ACCUSED. AND THAT
EXCEPTION REALLY GETS TO THE HEART OF WHAT THE PROSECUTION WANTS TO DO
WITH THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE. IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE TO EXPLAIN ANY CONDUCT OF THE VICTIM. THERE ISN'T ANY CONDUCT OF
THE VICTIM THAT IS IN ISSUE IN THIS CASE. IT'S SIMPLY NOT SOMETHING
WE'RE GOING TO LITIGATE, THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED. ITS ONLY PURPOSE IS
TO DRAW AN INFERENCE THAT IF SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF A BATTERING
RELATIONSHIP, THEN MR. SIMPSON WAS A BATTERER; AND, THEREFORE, IT'S MORE
LIKELY THAT HE COMMITTED THIS MURDER ON JUNE 12TH, 1994. AND THAT IS
PRECISELY THE USE OF THIS EVIDENCE THAT IS FORBIDDEN BY SECTION 1107 OF
THE EVIDENCE CODE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR
READING OF BLEDSOE AND BOWKER AND ARIS AND THE PEOPLE'S READING OF THOSE
CASES. WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT IS THAT IN ENACTING 1107, THE LEGISLATURE HAD
THE SAME UNDERSTANDING AS WE DO OF THOSE CASES AND DID NOT INTEND TO IN
ANY WAY DISTURB THE FORCE OF THOSE RULINGS AND WANTED TO ENACT A RULE
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE RULINGS, THAT THIS SYNDROME EVIDENCE WILL
NOT BE ADMISSIBLE FOR THE PURPOSE TO WHICH THE PEOPLE INTEND TO PUT IT.
ONE OF THE POTENTIAL USES OF THIS BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME, EXPERT
TESTIMONY WAS REVEALED IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY BY MS. BODIN'S ARGUMENT
WHERE SHE SUGGESTED THAT WHAT THEY REALLY WANTED TO DO WITH ALL OF THIS
HEARSAY EVIDENCE THAT THEY RECOGNIZE MAY NOT BE ADMISSIBLE WAS TO PUT
THE DEFENSE ON NOTICE, AND SHE EXPLAINED WHAT WE WERE BEING PUT ON
NOTICE OF. WE WERE BEING PUT ON NOTICE THAT IF THE DEFENDANT TESTIFIES,
SOME OF THIS MAY BE USED TO IMPEACH HIS TESTIMONY. AND THAT OF COURSE IS
A RISK WE'RE WELL AWARE OF. WE DON'T NEED TO BE PUT ON NOTICE OF THAT.
BUT SECONDLY, SHE SAYS, "AND WE'RE GOING TO BE CALLING AN EXPERT, AND
HEARSAY EVIDENCE IS USABLE BY AN EXPERT TO EXPLAIN THE BASIS OF THE
OPINION TO WHICH THE EXPERT COMES IF IT IS INFORMATION THAT EXPERTS IN
THIS FIELD ORDINARILY RELY ON." AND AT THAT POINT, A LITTLE ALARM SIGNAL
STARTED GOING OFF IN MY HEAD; THAT THE REAL AGENDA HERE WITH TRYING TO
BRING IN A BATTERED WOMEN'S EXPERT MAY SIMPLY BE TO FIND A WAY TO FUNNEL
IN ALL OF THE INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY BY HAVING THE EXPERT COME IN AND SAY,
"WELL, MY OPINION IS BASED ON THIS AND THIS AND THIS AND THIS," ALL OF
WHICH IS NOT ADMISSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S HEARSAY. AND THEN WE'LL INSTRUCT
THE JURY THAT THEY SHOULDN'T CONSIDER IT FOR THE TRUTH OF WHAT WAS BEING
ASSERTED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT IT SUPPORTS THE OPINION OF THE EXPERT.
SO THERE IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF PREJUDICE, OF THE ATTEMPTING TO
BRING IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY EVIDENCE IN THE
EMPLOYMENT OF THIS BATTERED WOMEN'S EXPERT AS WELL. AND I THINK THE
LEGISLATURE WAS WELL AWARE OF THOSE KINDS OF DANGERS WHEN IT ENACTED THE
PARTICULAR EXCEPTION IT ENACTED TO SECTION 1107. NOW, LET ME TURN TO THE
HEARSAY PROBLEMS IN THIS CASE. A PRINCIPAL HEARSAY PROBLEM IS GOING TO
BE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 911 TAPES. AND THERE ARE TWO 911 TAPES. THE 911
TAPE FOR THE 1989 INCIDENT WE WILL OBJECT TO AS SIMPLY IRRELEVANT. YOUR
HONOR WILL NOTE -- AND YOU HAVE A TRANSCRIPT OF THAT 911 CALL NOW --
THAT THE LEGEND INCLUDES AN END FOR THE STATEMENT OF NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON IN THAT CALL. AND THEN YOU READ THROUGH THE TRANSCRIPT, AND YOU
WON'T FIND AN END ANYWHERE IN THERE. THERE IS NOT ONE UTTERANCE IN THAT
ENTIRE TRANSCRIPT THAT IS ATTRIBUTED TO NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. THE
TRANSCRIPT IS SIMPLY A TRANSCRIPT OF SOMEBODY SCREAMING OVER THE
BACKGROUND OF A 911 OPERATOR. AND WE WILL CONTEND THAT EVIDENCE OF THAT
NATURE WOULD BE EXTREMELY PREJUDICIAL. IT WOULD HAVE NO PROBATIVE VALUE.
IT SHOULD BE EXCLUDED NOT JUST AS HEARSAY, BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD VIOLATE
352. IT GETS US NOWHERE IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING THAT INCIDENT OR WHAT
HAPPENED. THE 1993 TAPE PRESENTS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT PROBLEM FOR THE
COURT. AND I DON'T THINK YOUR HONOR CAN SIMPLY RULE THAT THAT TAPE IS
ADMISSIBLE OR NOT ADMISSIBLE WITHOUT CAREFULLY EXAMINING THE DIALOGUE
THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE COURSE OF THAT 14-MINUTE CONVERSATION. SIMPLY
SAYING THAT THIS IS A SPONTANEOUS STATEMENT DOES NOT MAKE THE WHOLE
14-MINUTE CONVERSATION ADMISSIBLE. THERE WERE PARTS OF THAT CONVERSATION
IN WHICH A VERY LUCID, CALM CONVERSATION WAS TAKING PLACE IN RESPONSE TO
VERY PROBING QUESTIONS. IT WAS NOT SPONTANEOUS AT ALL. AND EVEN WITH
RESPECT TO THOSE VERY DISCREET PARTS OF THE TRANSCRIPT THAT MIGHT BE
LABELED SPONTANEOUS, THEY CONTAIN MANY EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION. AND WE
CONTEND -- AND I'VE LOOKED AT GARCIA, AND I DON'T THINK GARCIA UNDERCUTS
THIS POSITION AT ALL. IN FACT, WE RELY ON PEOPLE VERSUS MYRON,
M-Y-R-O-N, A CASE THAT IS CITED IN OUR BRIEF FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT
EVEN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SPONTANEOUS DECLARATIONS, THERE MAY BE
EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION THAT ARE NOT ADMISSIBLE, THAT DO NOT COME WITHIN
THE HEARSAY EXCEPTION. THE TASK FOR THE COURT IN LOOKING AT THAT IS I
THINK WELL LAID OUT IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS FARMER. AND IN FARMER,
THE COURT INDICATED THAT THE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS IN DETERMINING WHETHER A
DECLARATION IS SUFFICIENTLY RELIABLE TO BE ADMISSIBLE UNDER THAT
EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE IS NOT THE NATURE OF THE STATEMENT, BUT
THE MENTAL STATE OF THE SPEAKER. AND THE REASON THAT THE COURT IN FARMER
FOUND THAT A 911 TAPE WAS ADMISSIBLE AS A SPONTANEOUS STATEMENT WAS
BECAUSE OF THE MENTAL STATE OF THE SPEAKER, WHO HAD JUST BEEN SHOT AND
WAS EXPERIENCING SEVERE PAIN AT THE TIME HE WAS SPEAKING INTO THE
TELEPHONE. AND THE COURT RECOGNIZED -- IT SAID:

"IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE RARELY HELD THE ANSWERS TO SUCH EXTENSIVE
QUESTIONING TO BE SPONTANEOUS UTTERANCES. NONETHELESS, THERE IS NO DOUBT
THAT THE DECLARANT HERE, SCHMIDT HILL, WAS EXCITED OR PERHAPS MORE
ACCURATELY DISTRAUGHT AND IN SEVERE PAIN. HE WAS NOT MERELY AN UNINJURED
PERSON WHOSE EXCITEMENT MIGHT WANE AND THUS BE IN A POSITION TO
FABRICATE ANSWERS THROUGH THE SOBERING INTERROGATION OF AN INVESTIGATOR.

"WHILE HE WAS BEING QUESTIONED, THE INTENSE PAIN OF HIS GUNSHOT WOUNDS
AND THE CONCERN HE RIGHTLY HAD ABOUT HIS SURVIVAL NO DOUBT PREOCCUPIED
HIM SO HE COULD NOT HAVE CONTEMPLATED SPINNING A FALSE TALE." AND THAT'S
VERY TELLING BECAUSE FROM THIS 911 CALL, WE DO HAVE AN UNINJURED WITNESS
WHO HAS NOT BEEN PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED, WHOSE EXCITEMENT MIGHT WANE AND
DOES WANE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE WANING IS VERY APPARENT IN A READING
OF THE TRANSCRIPT OF THAT 911 CALL. NOW, THE OTHER HEARSAY -- AND AGAIN,
IN OUR OPENING ARGUMENT, WE CHALLENGED THE PEOPLE TO SAY, WELL, COME UP
WITH A PLAUSIBLE HEARSAY EXCEPTION UNDER WHICH ALL OF THESE STATEMENTS
OF THE NICOLE -- OF THE VICTIM, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, TO OTHER THIRD
PARTIES COULD COME IN AS AN EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE. AND THE ONLY
EXCEPTION THAT THEY COULD COME UP WITH -- AND IT'S CITED WITH RESPECT TO
THE REMAINING HEARSAY THAT THEY STILL HAVE ON THE LIST, AND I'LL GO
THROUGH THESE ITEMS VERY QUICKLY JUST TO RESTATE OUR OBJECTIONS. THE
HEARSAY THAT IS STILL ON THIS LIST, THE ONLY LEGAL THEORY OFFERED BY THE
PEOPLE IS SECTION 1250 OF THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE. AND THEY'RE
SAYING THAT 1250 ALLOWS STATEMENTS OF FEAR, OF STATE OF MIND TO SHOW THE
DECLARANT'S STATE OF MIND OR TO EXPLAIN THE DECLARANT'S CONDUCT. THE
ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT THE DECLARANT'S STATE OF MIND AND THE
DECLARANT'S CONDUCT IS NOT IN ISSUE IN THIS CASE. THERE IS NOTHING TO
PROVE WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE OF MIND OR THE CONDUCT OF NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON WITH RESPECT TO THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE ON THE EVENING OF
JUNE 12TH. THE ATTEMPTS TO COME UP WITH SUCH AN EXPLANATION -- AND I
HAVE -- IF I COULD JUST HAVE A MOMENT.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MR. UELMEN:* HERE THEY ARE. IT WAS SUGGESTED, FIRST OF ALL, THAT THIS
EVIDENCE MIGHT SHOW THAT THE VICTIM WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE; THAT IF IN
FACT SHE HAD A FEAR OF MR. SIMPSON, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUTSIDE IF
SHE KNEW THE DEFENDANT WAS OUT THERE. AND OF COURSE, THAT ASSUMES THAT
THE DEFENDANT WAS OUT THERE. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY DISPUTE ABOUT
THAT. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY CONTENTS IN THIS CASE THAT THESE TWO
VICTIMS WERE NOT TAKEN BY SURPRISE. WE BELIEVE THEY WERE. THEY WERE
TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY THE PERSONS WHO COMMITTED THIS MURDER. THERE'S NO
EXPLANATION NECESSARY TO SHOW WHY THERE WOULD BE ANY DEGREE OF CAUTION
ON THE PART OF THE VICTIM THAT WOULD ARISE IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE PRIOR
HEARSAY STATEMENTS. AND THE OTHER THEORY IS THAT THIS EXPLAINS
ESTRANGEMENT; HER CONDUCT IN DISTANCING HERSELF SOMEHOW MOTIVATED THE
MURDER, THAT THESE HEARSAY STATEMENTS WILL SHOW THAT NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON WANTED TO DISENGAGE FROM MR. SIMPSON AND THAT SUPPLIES THE
MOTIVE FOR HIM MURDERING HER. YOU KNOW, THAT'S A PLAUSIBLE THEORY IF MR.
SIMPSON KNEW IT, BECAUSE THE STATE OF MIND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
PROVING AND THAT'S RELEVANT IN THIS CASE IN TERMS OF HIS MOTIVE FOR A
MURDER ONLY ARISES IF HE KNEW IN FACT THAT THESE STATEMENTS WERE MADE,
IF THESE STATEMENTS WERE MADE TO HIM OR THEY WERE COMMUNICATED TO HIM
SOMEHOW. SO THE FACT THAT MRS. SIMPSON MAKES A CALL, FOR EXAMPLE, TO A
BATTERED WOMAN'S SHELTER BEING OFFERED TO SHOW HER ESTRANGEMENT FROM HER
HUSBAND AND HER ATTEMPT TO SEPARATE HERSELF FROM HIM PROVES ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING IN TERMS OF HIS STATE OF MIND IF HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT CALL WAS
EVER MADE. THE ISSUE IN THIS CASE IS NOT MS. SIMPSON'S STATE OF MIND,
BUT MR. SIMPSON'S STATE OF MIND, WHAT HE KNEW IN TERMS OF ANY MOTIVE OF
ESTRANGEMENT. WHAT I FIND REMARKABLE IS THAT THE ONLY EXCEPTION SEIZED
UPON BY THE PEOPLE TO JUSTIFY THE ADMISSION OF THESE HEARSAY STATEMENTS
IS SECTION 1250(T) OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, AND SECTION 1250 OF THE
EVIDENCE CODE IS THE SAME EXCEPTION THAT WAS RELIED UPON IN IRELAND AND
IN ARCEGA. I DON'T THINK WE COULD HAVE -- I MEAN THIS IS AN UNUSUAL
POSITION FOR A DEFENSE POSITION TO HAVE, TO HAVE TWO RULINGS FROM THE
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ON ALL FOURS DIRECTLY IN HIS OR HER FAVOR. SO I
GUESS I WANT TO GLORY IN IT. I WANT TO REALLY RACK MYSELF UP IN THESE
CASES BECAUSE THEY ARE PRECISELY ON POINT. THEY DEAL WITH PRECISELY THE
SAME THEORY, THE SAME EXCEPTION. AND IN BOTH CASES, THE COURT SAID:

"IT IS REVERSIBLE ERROR TO ENTER INTO EVIDENCE HEARSAY STATEMENTS OF THE
VICTIM EXPRESSING FEAR OF THE DEFENDANT ACCUSED OF THE VICTIM'S MURDER
ON THE VERY DAY THAT THE VICTIM WAS MURDERED." YOU COULDN'T HAVE A
STRONGER MORE TELLING STATEMENT OF A LEGAL PRINCIPAL THAN WE HAVE IN
IRELAND AND ARCEGA, AND THAT SHOULD BE DETERMINATIVE OF THE ISSUE; THAT
THIS HEARSAY WILL NOT BE ADMISSIBLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE STATE OF MIND AND
THE CONDUCT OF THE VICTIM IS NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE. NOW,
TO CONCLUDE, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS JUST TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT TO
QUICKLY GO THROUGH THE APPRECIATED LIST THAT WE ARE NOW LEFT WITH AND
EXPRESS FOR THE COURT THE GROUNDS OF THE DEFENDANT'S OBJECTIONS TO THE
ADMISSION OF THESE REMAINING ITEMS. ITEM NUMBER 3, WE OBJECT TO ITS
ADMISSION ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS HEARSAY. MR. HUGHES' EXPLANATION OF
THIS RED SPOT IS SIMPLY RESTATING THE EXPLANATION THAT HE GOT FROM
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. AND THERE IS NO FOUNDATIONAL SHOWING OF ANY
EXCITED UTTERANCE IN THE COURSE OF THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN MS. SIMPSON
AND MR. HUGHES. AND WE ALSO OBJECT ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT IS IRRELEVANT
UNDER SECTION 1101 AND THAT ITS PREJUDICIAL IMPACT WOULD OUTWEIGH ITS
PROBATIVE VALUE UNDER SECTION 352. ITEM NUMBER 7, WE OBJECT VERY
STRONGLY ON THE GROUNDS OF 1101 ON THE GROUND THAT THERE IS NO
SIMILARITY. THERE IS NO SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE FACTS OF THIS INCIDENT
AND THE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE JUNE 12TH, 1994, AND ALSO ON GROUNDS OF
352, THAT ITS PROBATIVE VALUE IS OUTWEIGHED BY ITS PREJUDICIAL IMPACT.
ITEM NUMBER 8, WE WILL RAISE INITIALLY A 403 OBJECTION PRELIMINARILY TO
THE ADMISSION OF THIS EVIDENCE BECAUSE WE WILL CONTEND THAT THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE TO ESTABLISH THE DEFENDANT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THE
CONDUCT BEING DESCRIBED; THAT IS THE BREAKING OF PICTURE FRAMES. THE
MAID SIMPLY DESCRIBES ENTERING THE HOME AND FINDING BROKEN PICTURE
FRAMES WITHOUT ANY INDICATION OF WHO BROKE THEM. SO UNTIL THAT'S
ESTABLISHED, WE HAVE A 403 OBJECTION. IF IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT MR.
SIMPSON DID IT, WE WOULD CONTEND IT'S IRRELEVANT UNDER 1101, NO
SIMILARITY. IT DOESN'T PROVE ANY FACT OR ISSUE IN THIS CASE, AND WE ALSO
OBJECT ON GROUNDS OF 352. ITEM NUMBER 9, THE DAMAGE TO THE MERCEDES
AUTOMOBILE, AN INTERESTING CONTENTION HERE BECAUSE WE INDICATE THAT THE
EVIDENCE OF THIS WOULD COME FROM DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, WHO MADE NO
CONTEMPORANEOUS ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT, BUT ONLY WROTE IT UP IN A
LETTER FOUR YEARS LATER. AND THE PROSECUTORIAL RESPONSE WAS, "WELL, WE
DON'T JUST HAVE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN. WE HAVE A LOS ANGELES POLICE SERGEANT
WHO FORMERLY WORKED FOR WESTEC SECURITY WHO ALSO WILL GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF
THIS INCIDENT." AND WHEN WE LOOKED THROUGH THE DISCOVERY -- AND I
BELIEVE MARK DAY IS HIS NAME -- AT THE STATEMENT FOR MR. DAY, WE
DISCOVERED THAT MR. DAY'S STATEMENT WAS DATED 1994. THAT IS, MR. DAY WAS
SIMPLY RECOUNTING FROM MEMORY AFTER HE SPOKE TO MR. FUHRMAN OF WHAT HAD
HAPPENED NINE YEARS BEFORE WHEN HE WAS WORKING AS A WESTEC SECURITY
GUARD. AND WE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL ESTABLISH SUBSTANTIAL
CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THE VERSION OF THIS EVENT PRESENTED BY DETECTIVE
FUHRMAN AND THE VERSION OF THIS EVENT PRESENTED BY SERGEANT DAY. SO ON
THAT GROUND, WE WILL ASK FOR A 403 DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT ACTUALLY
HAPPENED BEFORE THE COURT ADMITS THE EVIDENCE, AND WE WILL OBJECT BOTH
ON GROUNDS OF 1101, RELEVANCY, AND 352. THE BICYCLE INCIDENT, ITEM
NUMBER 10, ALSO PRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL 403 PRELIMINARY QUESTION BECAUSE
THIS INCIDENT OF COURSE IS NOT GOING TO BE ADMISSIBLE UNLESS WE HAVE
SOME EVIDENCE OF HOW THE INJURIES OCCURRED. AND SIMPLY BRINGING IN A
PHYSICIAN WHO SAYS, "WELL, I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I WAS BEING TOLD THE
TRUTH WITH RESPECT TO THIS INJURY OCCURRING" -- AND FALLING OFF A
BICYCLE DOESN'T GET US VERY FAR IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING HOW THE INJURIES
DID OCCUR -- THE INJURIES ARE TOTALLY IRRELEVANT UNLESS THEY WERE THE
RESULT OF SOME SORT OF ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR BY MR. SIMPSON AND THAT
BEHAVIOR HAS SOME SORT OF SIMILARITY TO THE BEHAVIOR INVOLVED IN THIS
MURDER ON JUNE 12TH. SO WE'LL OBJECT IN TERMS OF 403 THAT THERE'S NO
PRELIMINARY SHOWING THAT IT'S EVEN RELATED TO MR. SIMPSON, AND IF THAT
OBSTACLE IS OVERCOME, ON THE GROUNDS OF BOTH 1101 AND 352. THE "DISNEY
ON ICE" INCIDENT WE WILL OBJECT ON GROUNDS OF 1101 AND 352. THE INCIDENT
BEARS NO SIMILARITY TO ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THE
COMMISSION OF THIS MURDER, AND THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DANGER OF PREJUDICE
OUTWEIGHING ITS PROBATIVE VALUE. ITEM NUMBER 13 OF COURSE IS THE JANUARY
1ST, 1989 INCIDENT THAT RESULTED IN A NO CONTEST PLEA IN A CRIMINAL
PROCEEDING. SO THE OBJECTION HERE WILL BE THREEFOLD. FIRST OF ALL, UNDER
1101, THE LACK OF SIMILARITY OF THIS INCIDENT TO ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED
JUNE 12TH MAKES IT IRRELEVANT. UNDER 352, ITS PROBATIVE VALUE IS FAR
OUTWEIGHED BY ITS PREJUDICIAL IMPACT. AND THEN SEPARATELY, WE OBJECT ON
THE GROUNDS OF HEARSAY TO THE USE OF THE 911 TAPE TO CORROBORATE THAT
INCIDENT. THERE WILL BE NO OBJECTION TO THE LETTER IN WHICH THE
DEFENDANT AGREES TO VOID THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT. OH, NUMBER 11. I NEED
TO GO BACK. NUMBER 11 IS THE INCIDENT REFERRED TO AS HUMILIATION OF MRS.
SIMPSON BY MR. SIMPSON'S EXPRESSIONS OF OUTRAGE THAT A GAY MAN HAD
KISSED ONE OF THEIR CHILDREN. THERE'S GOING TO BE A 403 HEARING
NECESSARY IF THIS INCIDENT IS OFFERED BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE
WILL SHOW A VERY DIFFERENT FACTUAL SCENARIO; THAT IN FACT MR. SIMPSON'S
OUTRAGE WAS ENGENDERED BY A STATEMENT BY NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON CALLING
MR. SIMPSON'S FATHER A FAG, KIND OF A REVERSE HUMILIATION. I THINK IT'S
WORTH NOTING THAT ALL OF THE HUMILIATION IN THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS NOT A
ONE-WAY STREET. AND WITH RESPECT TO THIS INCIDENT IN PARTICULAR, THERE
IS A SUBSTANTIAL VARIANCE IN THE EVIDENCE AS TO HOW IT HAPPENED AND WHAT
ITS SIGNIFICANCE ACTUALLY IS. ONCE WE GET PAST THAT, WE WOULD CONTEND OF
COURSE THAT IT BEARS NO SIMILARITY WHATSOEVER TO ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED
IN 1994 AND ITS PREJUDICIAL IMPACT WOULD FAR OUTWEIGH ITS PROBATIVE
VALUE. ITEM NO. 16, WE HAVE A VERY SIMPLE LETTER SAYING -- THERE'S AN
OBJECTION TO THAT. THE ONLY EXCEPTION RELIED UPON IS 1250, AND WE WOULD
ANSWER THAT BY SAYING THE STATE OF MIND OR THE CONDUCT OF NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON IS SIMPLY NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THIS
STATEMENT OR ANY STATEMENT MADE BY MS. SIMPSON. ITEM NUMBER 17, WE'RE IN
A DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATES TO WHICH THIS
INCIDENT OCCURRED WITHIN AN ENTIRE TWO-YEAR SPREAD. WE'RE SIMPLY TOLD
THIS HAPPENED SOMETIME IN 1988 OR 1989. THE DATE BECOMES VERY
SIGNIFICANT, YOUR HONOR, BECAUSE JANUARY 1ST, 1989 WAS THE INCIDENT
LEADING TO THE AGREEMENT THAT THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT WOULD BE VOIDED
IF THERE WAS ANY ACTIVE PHYSICAL ASSAULT. AND HERE WE HAVE A WITNESS
THAT SAID, "I SAW AN ACTIVE PHYSICAL ASSAULT. I SAW MR. SIMPSON
BACK-HAND HIS WIFE IN THE BACK OF A LIMOUSINE EITHER IN 1988 OR 1989."
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THIS OCCURRED. AND UNTIL THE PEOPLE CAN SPECIFY
WITH SOME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY WHEN THIS HAPPENED, SOME OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH THIS MIGHT BE RECONSTRUCTED, WE BELIEVE THE
DEFENDANT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY PREJUDICED BY HAVING TO ANSWER TO A
CHARGE LIKE THIS AS A CHARGE OF RELATED CONDUCT THAT HE HAS TO EXPLAIN
SOMEHOW IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL. ASSUMING WE GET OVER THAT OBSTACLE,
OF COURSE WE STILL RESERVE ON 1101 AND A 352 OBJECTION ON THE GROUNDS
THAT THIS BEARS NO SIMILARITY. THERE IS NO EXPLANATION OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES FROM WHICH THIS CAN EVEN BE TIED TO ANY EVENTS TAKING
PLACE ON JUNE 12TH, 1994. THE RED ONION INCIDENT, NUMBER 18, AGAIN, WE
HAVE AN 1101 AND A 352 OBJECTION ON THE GROUNDS THAT THERE IS NO
SIMILARITY. ITEM 21, THERE WON'T BE ANY CONTENTION ABOUT THE FILING OF
THE DIVORCE. ITEM 22, THE MEZZALUNA INCIDENT AND ITEM 23, THE TRYST
INCIDENT, BOTH ALLEGES CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE MR. SIMPSON IS OBSERVED IN A
RESTAURANT AT THE SAME TIME THAT MRS. SIMPSON IS. AND IN ONE CASE, IT IS
ALLEGED HE STARED AT THE PEOPLE SHE WAS WITH, AND IN ANOTHER INCIDENT,
HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THOSE PEOPLE. NOW, THE RELEVANCE OF THIS THE
PEOPLE ARGUE IS THAT IT'S GOING TO SHOW STALKING. AND AT THIS POINT, I
THINK IT'S WORTH THE COURT NOTING THAT STALKING IS A LEGAL TERM THAT HAS
A LEGAL DEFINITION. THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE, SECTION 646.9 DEFINES
STALKING TO ENCOMPASS ANY PERSON WILLFULLY, MALICIOUSLY AND REPEATEDLY
FOLLOWING OR HARASSING ANOTHER PERSON. NOW, WE WILL IMPOSE A SIGNIFICANT
AND SUBSTANTIAL 403 OBJECTION TO THE JURY HEARING ANY OF THIS EVIDENCE
UNTIL IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON IS STALKING. IT'S
IRRELEVANT THAT MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE OR HIS FORMER WIFE HAPPENED TO
FREQUENT THE SAME RESTAURANTS. IN FACT, THERE'S A VERY REASONABLE
EXPLANATION FOR THAT. IF IN THE COURSE OF A 17-YEAR RELATIONSHIP PEOPLE
HAVE A NUMBER OF FAVORITE RESTAURANTS, JUST THE FACT THAT THEY GET
DIVORCED DOESN'T MEAN THAT ONE OF THEM HAS TO STOP GOING TO THEIR
FAVORITE RESTAURANT. AND IT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US AT ALL THAT THESE TWO
PEOPLE HAPPENED TO ON OCCASION FIND THEMSELVES IN THE SAME RESTAURANT.
AND SIMPLY TO INFER FROM THAT FACT ALONE, WHICH IS WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
THAT THAT'S SOME SORT OF STALKING ACTIVITY IS NOT AN INFERENCE THAT CAN
BE JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE. SO WE'LL OBJECT NOT ONLY ON 403 GROUNDS,
THAT THIS IS NOT STALKING ACTIVITY, BUT ON GROUNDS OF 1101 AND 352 AS
WELL, THAT THIS ACTIVITY BEARS NO RELATIONSHIP OR NO SIMILARITY TO WHAT
HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH. THE ENDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MR.
ZLOMSOWITCH IS RELEVANT ONLY IF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. ZLOMSOWITCH
BECOMES EVIDENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND WITH RESPECT TO THAT INCIDENT,
WE HAVE ARGUED THAT THE INFERENCE THEY WANT TO DRAW FROM IT IS JUST
COUNTER TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. I MEAN THE FACT THAT MR. SIMPSON
DIDN'T BARGE IN, DIDN'T INTERRUPT THEM, DID NOT CONFRONT THEM IN AN
ANGRY MANNER SIMPLY UNDERCUTS ANY SUGGESTION THAT THIS IS A PRIOR SYMBOL
OR INCIDENT THAT EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE 12TH, 1994.
IN FACT, IT MAKES THE SCENARIO THAT THE PEOPLE WANT TO PRESENT OF WHAT
HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH LESS LIKELY RATHER THAN MORE LIKELY. WITH RESPECT
TO ITEM 27 -- AND THERE'S A RELATED ITEM, NUMBER 41. THESE ARE BOTH
STATEMENTS ALLEGEDLY MADE BY MR. SIMPSON TO MRS. SIMPSON'S MOTHER,
JUDITHA BROWN, REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HE AND HER DAUGHTER.
AND I ASK THE COURT IN BOTH OF THESE INSTANCES TO LOOK AT THE PRECISE
LANGUAGE PROFFERED BY THE PEOPLE OF WHAT WAS SAID. IN ITEM NUMBER 27,
WHAT WAS SAID WAS, "PEOPLE SAY I SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM HER, BUT I CAN'T.
I LOVE HER. I LOVE HER. PEOPLE TELL ME TO LET HER GO, AND I CAN'T LET
HER GO." NOW, WHEN WE ASK, WELL, WHAT'S THE RELEVANCE OF THAT OTHER THAN
SHOWING THAT IN THE COURSE OF A DIVORCE, MR. SIMPSON STILL LOVED HIS
WIFE, THE RELEVANCE THE PEOPLE ASSERT IS TO CITE THIS CASE OF DE MOSS,
PEOPLE VERSUS DE MOSS, IN WHICH THE STATEMENT ALLEGED WAS, "IF I CAN'T
HAVE HER, NOBODY CAN." THAT'S A THREAT. SAYING, "I LOVE HER. I CAN'T LET
HER GO," IS NOT A THREAT, AND WE WOULD CONTEND THAT THESE STATEMENTS
HAVE NO RELEVANCE IF THEY CANNOT BE CHARACTERIZED AS THREATS. ITEM
NUMBER 41 -- EXCUSE ME.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. UELMEN:* THE STATEMENT INVOLVED IN ITEM NUMBER 27 WAS IN 1992
DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE DIVORCE. IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE IN PROXIMITY TO
THE EVENTS OF JUNE 12TH, 1994. SO IT WOULDN'T EVEN SHOW A STATE OF MIND
THAT WOULD BE IN EXISTENCE TWO YEARS LATER. SO TO THAT EXTENT, IT IS
IRRELEVANT, AND ITS PREJUDICIAL IMPACT OUTWEIGHS ITS PROBATIVE VALUE.
AND THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF ITEM 41, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS CLOSER IN
PROXIMITY. THIS IS MARCH OF 1994. THE STATEMENT IS, "THE ONLY WOMAN I
WANT IN MY LIFE AND I CAN'T HAVE IS YOUR DAUGHTER." THAT'S NOT A THREAT
AND IT BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE DE MOSS STATEMENT CITED AS AUTHORITY,
"IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NOBODY ELSE WILL." SO WE OBJECT SIMPLY ON GROUNDS
OF IRRELEVANCE AND ON GROUNDS OF 352 AS WELL.

*THE COURT:* MADAM REPORTER, DO WE NEED TO CHANGE REPORTERS?

*THE COURT REPORTER:* NO. I'M FINE.

*THE COURT:* MR. UELMEN.

*MR. UELMEN:* ITEM 28 IS NOT -- AN ATTEMPT -- SIMPLY THAT THERE WAS AN
ATTEMPT AT RECONCILIATION, AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE DISPUTE
ABOUT THAT. NUMBER 29, THE CALIFORNIA SUSHI, WE OBJECT FIRST OF ALL ON
GROUNDS OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED REQUIRING A 403 HEARING, SECTION 1101,
A LACK OF SIMILARITY, AND SECTION 352, THE PREJUDICIAL IMPACT
OUTWEIGHING THE PROBATIVE VALUE. ITEM 30, THE SAME OBJECTIONS. ITEM 31,
ITEM 32, AGAIN, LABELING THESE AS STALKING WILL REQUIRE A PRELIMINARY
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT THAT THIS IS IN FACT WHAT WAS GOING ON, THAT
MR. SIMPSON DID NOT HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON TO BE VISITING THE
PREMISES. ONLY AFTER THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED WOULD THESE THEN BE
ADMISSIBLE. BUT WE WOULD MAINTAIN THEY SHOULD BE EXCLUDED UNDER 1101
BECAUSE THEY BEAR NO SIMILARITY TO WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12, 1994, AND
ON THE GROUNDS OF 352. ITEMS 33 AND 34, AGAIN, WE RESTATE OUR HEARSAY
OBJECTION. THE ONLY EXCEPTION ASSERTED IS 1250 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE. AND
AGAIN, WE RESPOND, THE STATE OF MIND OR THE CONDUCT OF THE DECLARANT OF
THESE HEARSAY STATEMENTS OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WILL NOT BE AN ISSUE IN
THESE PROCEEDINGS. THAT BRINGS US TO THE 911 INCIDENT IN OCTOBER OF
1993. AND HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER 911 TAPE. AND I'VE ALREADY ADDRESSED THE
PROBLEM THAT THE COURT WILL HAVE IN RULING ON OUR HEARSAY OBJECTION. AND
AT SOME POINT, IT MAY BE THAT THE COURT WILL WANT TO PROPOSE SOME SORT
OF REDACTION OF THE TRANSCRIPT OF THIS TAPE AND SUGGEST THAT PARTS OF IT
MAY BE PRESENTED TO THE JURY IN A WRITTEN FORM WITHOUT ACTUALLY PLAYING
THE TAPE. BUT EVEN GETTING PAST THE HEARSAY PROBLEM WITH THE 911 TAPE
DOES NOT DISPOSE OF THE 1101 PROBLEM, OF WHETHER THIS INCIDENT BEARS ANY
SIMILARLY WHATSOEVER TO WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12. THE FACT THAT THE
PARTIES HAVE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHOSE PICTURES ARE IN THE FAMILY ALBUM
AND THAT ARGUMENT RESULTS IN A BROKEN DOOR SIMPLY DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY
EVIDENCE OF PROBATIVE VALUE TO EXPLAIN THE INTENT OR THE MOTIVE OR THE
IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR OF THE JUNE 12TH INCIDENT. AND AGAIN, I
UNDERLINE THAT IDENTITY IS THE REAL ISSUE IN CONTENTION HERE. THERE ARE
NO SIGNATURE FACTS HERE THAT WOULD JUSTIFY USING THIS TO PROVE THE
IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR OF THE MURDER ON JUNE 12TH. ITEM 38, THE
FACT THAT MISS SIMPSON MOVED TO THE BUNDY ADDRESS, THERE WILL BE NO
ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT. ITEM 40, WE ASSERT A HEARSAY EXCEPTION, AGAIN,
1250, THE ONLY EXCEPTION RELIED UPON. THIS IS SIMPLY A STATEMENT BY THE
VICTIM WHICH CANNOT BE CROSS-EXAMINED, AND HER STATE OF MIND AND CONDUCT
AT THE TIME THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TO ANY ISSUES
IN THIS CASE. ITEM 41 I HAVE ALSO ADDRESSED. ITEM 42, WE'LL RAISE A
SUBSTANTIAL 403 QUESTION IN TERMS OF WHETHER THESE STATEMENTS WERE
ACTUALLY MADE. AND IF THEY WERE MADE, THEIR RELEVANCY REMAINS IN
QUESTION, AND WE WILL OBJECT TO THEM AS IRRELEVANT. ITEM 47, SIMPLY THE
FACT THAT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT AT RECONCILIATION WILL NOT BE CONTESTED
IN THIS CASE. ITEM 48, AGAIN, WE OBJECT ON THE GROUNDS OF HEARSAY. WE
BELIEVE THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE PRESENTED OF THIS TRANSACTION IS A
STATEMENT OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, WHICH CANNOT BE CROSS-EXAMINED AND
THERE'S NO HEARSAY OBJECTION EVEN ASSERTED HERE. THE IRS LETTER, AGAIN,
WE SIMPLY OBJECT TO THAT AS IRRELEVANT. IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN ANY CONDUCT
IN THIS CASE. AND WE INVITE THE COURT TO LOOK AT THAT LETTER AND SEE
THAT IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY THREATS OR ANY ATTEMPT TO COERCE MRS.
SIMPSON. ITEMS 52 AND 53, AGAIN, SIMPLE HEARSAY OBJECTIONS, AGAIN 1250
BEING THE ONLY EXCEPTION RELIED UPON AND, AGAIN, THE STATE OF MIND AND
THE CONDUCT OF THE VICTIM WILL NOT BE IN QUESTION. THE DANCE RECITAL,
THERE WON'T BE ANY ISSUE ABOUT THAT. AS TO THE MURDER ITSELF, THE ONLY
ISSUE AS I MENTIONED WILL BE THE ISSUE OF IDENTITY OF WHO DID IT. THE
ASHTON STREET INCIDENT THAT WAS ADDED, WE HAVE A 403 OBJECTION AS TO
WHAT, IF ANYTHING, THIS PROVES IF THE WITNESSES ARE NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY
THIS AS AN ACTUAL ALTERCATION BETWEEN MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE SINCE
THEY ARE SIMPLY RELYING ON WHAT THEY HEARD THROUGH A BEDROOM WALL. WE
HAVE A 403 PROBLEM EVEN BEFORE WE GET TO THE 1101 EXCEPTION, AND WE WILL
OBJECT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THERE IS NO SIMILARITY UNDER 1101. AND THE
352 OBJECTION HERE I THINK IS PARTICULARLY STRONG BECAUSE OF THE
REMOTENESS OF THIS INCIDENT. WE ARE TALKING HERE ABOUT AN INCIDENT THAT
IS 17 YEARS OLD. THE VICTORIA BEACH INCIDENT, AGAIN, THE 403 ISSUE OF
WHETHER THIS WITNESS CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS
TRANSACTION NINE YEARS AFTER IT HAPPENED WILL BE IN ISSUE. AND ASSUMING
WE GET OVER THAT, WE WILL RAISE AN 1101 OBJECTION AND A 352 OBJECTION.
AND THEN FINALLY, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOJOURN CONTACT, WE HAVE A HEARSAY
OBJECTION AND CONTEND THAT THE ONLY EXCEPTION RELIED UPON 1250 GETS US
NOWHERE BECAUSE THE STATE OF MIND AND THE CONDUCT OF THE VICTIM ARE NOT
GOING TO BE IN ISSUE. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CONFER WITH COUNSEL.

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. UELMEN:* I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CONCLUDE WITH WHERE I BEGAN; AND THAT
IS THE INSISTENCE OF MR. SIMPSON'S RIGHT TO BE TRIED FOR WHAT HE DID
RATHER THAN FOR WHO HE IS. THAT'S GOING TO BE PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT
IN THE CONTEXT OF A CASE WHERE WHO DID IT IS REALLY THE ONLY ISSUE TO BE
LITIGATED. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC CASE OF THE BATTERED WIFE SYNDROME.
THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF WHO DONE IT, AND WE WILL CONTEND THAT THIS
MURDER WAS DONE BY PARTIES OTHER THAN MR. SIMPSON, AND THAT IS THE ONLY
ISSUE WE'RE GOING TO LITIGATE, AND ALL OF THE QUESTIONS OF PREJUDICE TO
MR. SIMPSON MUST BE EVALUATED WITH THAT THOUGHT IN MIND.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. ALL RIGHT. GIVEN THE NUMBER
OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THE COURT, SEVERAL DISTINCT
ISSUES, ARGUMENT, OBJECTIONS, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, I DON'T FEEL
PREPARED TO RULE ON THE MOTION AT THIS TIME. AND I'VE INDICATED THAT I
WILL LIKELY -- MY INCLINATION TOMORROW IS TO TAKE UP THE MOTION TO QUASH
THE SUBPOENA FOR MARGUERITE SIMPSON AND TO TAKE UP THE ARGUMENT ON THE
FUHRMAN MOTION. AND MY INCLINATION AND INTENT IS TO ISSUE A WRITTEN
RULING AS TO EACH OF THESE 60 ODD INCIDENTS TUESDAY MORNING, JANUARY
17TH, OR AT THE LATEST, THE 18TH.

*MR. GORDON:* YOUR HONOR, GIVEN SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT MR. UELMEN
MADE, MAY WE RESERVE ABOUT 10 MINUTES TOMORROW MORNING TO RESPOND?

*THE COURT:* WELL, IT'S A MOTION --

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE'RE THE MOVING PARTY.

*MR. GORDON:* I UNDERSTAND. WE'RE THE PROPONENTS OF THE EVIDENCE. WE
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES -- THIS IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT
EVIDENCE. WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES OF THE COURT'S TIME
IN THE MORNING TO RESPOND.

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I JUST BE HEARD? WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION EARLIER. WE
ARE THE MOVING PARTY AND WE FILED THE MOTION. WE DIDN'T INTERRUPT THEM
AT ALL. WE LET THEM FINISH ALL THEIR PRESENTATION, AND NOW WE HAVE
CONCLUDED. AND IF THEY DO THAT, THEN I'M SURE THERE WILL BE SOME THINGS
WE WANT TO SAY. I THINK THE COURT HAS HEARD ENOUGH OVER THE COURSE --
AND YOU'VE BEEN VERY PATIENT -- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

*MR. GORDON:* WE'RE THE PROPONENTS OF THIS EVIDENCE. THIS IS EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT. AS THE COURT INDICATED, THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE TO YOU,
AND THERE'S SOME INFORMATION WE WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THE COURT, RESPOND
TO. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO --

*THE COURT:* CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION, WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

*MR. GORDON:* WE HAVE SOME SHORT RESPONSE TO THIS.

*MS. BODIN:* YOUR HONOR, WE'RE THE PROPONENTS OF THE EVIDENCE. WE ALSO
BEAR THE BURDEN ON THIS. AND I THINK THAT ENTITLES US TO SOME REBUTTAL
TO WHAT THE DEFENDANT HAS PRESENTED. WE DON'T WANT TO PRESENT NEW
EVIDENCE, BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT BRIEFLY UPON SOME OF THE
ARGUMENTS THAT MR. UELMEN HAS MADE. AND BECAUSE WE DO BEAR THE BURDEN, I
BELIEVE WE ALSO, WITH THAT BURDEN, HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THAT. AND I WOULD
ASK THE COURT TO GIVE US A MOMENT, BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD DEFER TO
WHATEVER THE COURT WANTS TO DO. BUT SPECIFICALLY --

*THE COURT:* ANYTHING THAT'S NOT COVERED IN THE POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
THAT YOU'VE SUBMITTED? ANYTHING THAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE CASE LAW?

*MS. BODIN:* THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FACTUAL REPRESENTATIONS THAT WERE
MADE BY MR. UELMEN THAT ARE FRANKLY NOT TRUE, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD
TO A DEPOSITION. AND I WOULD LIKE TO CITE THE COURT TO THAT. I COULD
BRIEFLY DO THAT. IT IS 10 MINUTES BEFORE 5:00. WOULD THE COURT LIKE ME
TO DO IT RIGHT NOW?

*THE COURT:* WELL, HERE'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. THIS TYPE OF MOTION IS
NORMALLY DONE ON OFFERS OF PROOF. AND EACH SIDE HAS CONTROL OVER THE
RECORD THAT THEY CREATE. AND THAT DEPOSITION IS NOT BEFORE ME. NOBODY
HAS CHOSEN TO OFFER IT TO ME. NOW, I AGREED THAT I WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT
FROM THE PROSECUTION A NOTEBOOK CATALOGING THE REPORTS, ET CETERA, ET
CETERA, SO THAT I HAVE A FACTUAL BACKGROUND SO I CAN MAKE MY RULINGS AS
TO EACH ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS. I ASSUME THAT WILL INCLUDE THE
DEPOSITION. SO DO WE NEED TO ARGUE ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THIS?

*MS. BODIN:* THE COURT MAKES AN EXCELLENT POINT. THE FINAL POINT I WISH
TO MAKE IS THIS.

*THE COURT:* THIS HAS TO DO WITH YOUR ABILITY TO REOPEN YOUR ARGUMENT.

*MS. BODIN:* ALL RIGHT, YOUR HONOR. GIVEN THAT, IN OUR ABILITY TO GIVE
THE COURT EVIDENCE IN A NOTEBOOK THAT THE COURT HAS REQUESTED, I WILL
DEFER TO THE COURT'S JUDGMENT. WITH REGARD TO NOT GIVING REBUTTAL, IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN SHORT IN ANY CASE. AND FRANKLY, THE FACTS IN THIS CASE,
AT LEAST FROM THIS MOTION, SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. I DO HAVE ONE OTHER
ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP RELEVANT TO SOME COMMENTS MR. UELMEN MADE
GOING TO DISCOVERY. MAY I BRIEFLY MAKE THOSE COMMENTS?

*THE COURT:* WITH REGARD TO DISCOVERY ISSUES.

*MS. BODIN:* THE OFFER OF PROOF MADE BY MR. UELMEN TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER
OF WITNESSES WITH REGARDS TO CERTAIN EVENTS. AND DURING THE COURSE OF
HIS ARGUMENT -- FOR EXAMPLE, HE INDICATES THAT THEY HAVE WITNESSES WITH
REGARD TO NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON -- AND IF I JUST MAY GO TO THE PODIUM --
AND HER EMPLOYMENT AND MADE AN OFFER OF PROOF WITH RESPECT TO THAT, AND
HE SAID THAT THE DEFENSE HAD WITNESSES ON THAT. WE HAVE LOOKED THROUGH
OUR DISCOVERY THIS AFTERNOON AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN OUR
DISCOVERY WITH REGARD TO THAT. AN OFFER OF PROOF HAS BEEN MADE. WE
CERTAINLY ARE BACKING UP OUR OFFER OF PROOF TO THE COURT WITH A NOTEBOOK
PROVIDED TO THE COURT OF WHAT WE THINK ARE VERY RELEVANT DOCUMENTS. WE
ASSUME THAT THE DEFENSE WOULD THEN DO THE SAME THING BASED ON MR.
UELMEN'S ARGUMENT. THERE WAS ALSO SOME TALK ABOUT A PAYMENT FOR MEALS. I
ASSUME THERE MUST BE SOME FINANCIAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE IN POSSESSION
OF. THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER ISSUES THAT THE DEFENSE HAS REFERENCED
WHERE THEY HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PRESENT EVIDENCE; IN
PARTICULARLY, WITH REGARD TO -- I BELIEVE TO THE ISSUE OF THE EVENT AT
THE RED ONION. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT BACKS
UP THE OFFERS OF PROOF THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BY MR. UELMEN WITH
REGARD TO THOSE EVENTS, AND WE SIMPLY ASK FOR THAT BECAUSE HE HAS MADE
OFFERS TO THE COURT.

*THE COURT:* DOES IT REQUIRE THAT THEY TURN OVER REBUTTAL EVIDENCE TO
YOU AT THIS POINT?

*MS. BODIN:* WE MADE AN OFFER OF PROOF IN A HEARING THAT THEY ASKED FOR --

*THE COURT:* WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, MS. BODIN, MY THOUGHT PROCESS
IS NOW ON THE MOTION ITSELF AND NOT ON THE DETAILS OF DISCOVERY. SO I'LL
CONTEMPLATE DISCOVERY ISSUES TOMORROW MORNING WITH A HOPEFULLY RESTED
MIND AND CLEAR THOUGHT PROCESS. WE'LL GO INTO THE MOTIONS REGARDING
MOTION TO QUASH AND THE FUHRMAN MOTIONS. I ANTICIPATE WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO CONCLUDE THOSE MOTIONS BY TOMORROW. LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A HEADS UP
SO YOU CAN PREPARE FOR OPENING STATEMENTS. ASSUMING THAT I ISSUE THE
RULING AND EVERYTHING IS CLEAR ON WHAT THE RULINGS ARE AND THEY CAN
PREPARE THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL NEED APPROXIMATELY
HALF A COURT DAY TO CHAT WITH THE JURORS AGAIN, AS I INDICATED WE WOULD.
I NEED APPROXIMATELY HALF A DAY TO SWAP COMPUTERS AND DO A FEW OTHER
THINGS LOGISTICALLY TO GET READY FOR THE PRESENTATION. SO THAT COULD GET
US TO THE 19TH OR THE 20TH FOR OPENING STATEMENTS.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE WILL BE READY, YOUR HONOR. WE ARE READY.

*MR. GORDON:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*MS. LEWIS:* YOUR HONOR, BEFORE THE COURT ADJOURNS, MAY WE HAVE A
SIDEBAR CONFERENCE WITH COUNSEL OFF THE RECORD?

*THE COURT:* SURE.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT, COUNSEL. WE'LL STAND IN RECESS UNTIL 9:00 A.M.
TOMORROW MORNING. THANK YOU.
