*LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 11, 1995 9:05 A.M.*

DEPARTMENT NO. 103 HON. LANCE A. ITO, JUDGE

APPEARANCES: (APPEARANCES AS HERETOFORE NOTED,
DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY HANK;
ALSO PRESENT ON BEHALF OF
SOJOURN, MS. PAMELA W. WITHEY,
ATTORNEY-AT-LAW.)

(JANET M. MOXHAM, CSR NO. 4855, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(CHRISTINE M. OLSON, CSR NO. 2378, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THE SIMPSON MATTER.

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY WE APPROACH, YOUR HONOR, AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME?

*THE COURT:* AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME?

*MR. COCHRAN:* WHEN YOU DEEM APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD LIKE TO APPROACH.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

*THE COURT:* BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. MR. SIMPSON IS
AGAIN PRESENT BEFORE THE COURT WITH HIS COUNSEL, MR. SHAPIRO, MR.
COCHRAN, MR. BAILEY, MR. UELMEN, THE PEOPLE REPRESENTED BY MS. BODIN AND
MR. DARDEN TODAY. AND WE HAVE ON A FIRST -- AS OUR FIRST MATTER A MOTION
TO QUASH A SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM, AND THAT MOTION WAS FILED BY
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SOJOURN PROGRAM. MS. WITHEY.

*MS. WITHEY:* PAMELA WITHEY APPEARING FOR SOJOURN. YOUR HONOR, I TRUST
THE COURT REVIEWED THE PAPERS AND ALSO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S RESPONSE
TO THOSE PAPERS AND --

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, WHY DON'T YOU USE THE PODIUM WITH THE MIKE.

*MS. WITHEY:* YOUR HONOR HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE PAPERS
AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DID PREPARE A RESPONSE TO THOSE PAPERS WHICH
SETS FORTH THE ISSUES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ADDRESSED. SOJOURN
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE CERTAIN SPECIFIC FINDINGS MADE; AND IF THOSE FINDINGS
ARE MADE, THEN WE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH PROVIDING WHATEVER DOCUMENTS ARE
LEGALLY ALLOWED TO BE PRODUCED. OUR FIRST CONCERN WAS THAT THE TRUSTEE,
LOUIS BROWN, BE AUTHORIZED TO INSTRUCT A COUNSELOR OF THE PROGRAM TO
PERMIT DISCLOSURE. SOJOURN IS CONCERNED THAT STRICT CONFIDENTIALITY MAY
BE MAINTAINED AS SET FORTH IN THE EVIDENCE CODE, AND WE WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT ANY CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS NOT BE COMPELLED. HOWEVER, THE
CODE SECTION VERY SPECIFICALLY SETS FORTH CERTAIN CONDITIONS UPON WHICH
DISCLOSURE MAY BE COMPELLED BY THE COURT. THE SUBPOENA THAT WAS RECEIVED
BY THE PROJECT DIRECTOR HAD ATTACHED TO IT A PURPORTED WAIVER EXECUTED
BY LOUIS BROWN. SO ONE OF OUR FIRST ISSUES WAS WHETHER OR NOT THE
TRUSTEE CAN INSTRUCT THE COUNSELOR OF THE PROGRAM TO PERMIT DISCLOSURE
AS IS SET FORTH IN THE EVIDENCE CODE. THE SECOND ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT
THE WAIVER ITSELF, WHICH WAS ATTACHED, IS SUFFICIENT. THERE WAS AN
INITIAL WAIVER THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE SUBPOENA AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY A
DIFFERENT WAIVER WAS PROVIDED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHICH
WAS MORE SPECIFIC AND WHICH ADDRESSES ITSELF SPECIFICALLY TO SOJOURN,
WHICH I THINK IS BETTER. AND THIRDLY, IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THE
TRUSTEE IS AUTHORIZED TO PERMIT -- IS AUTHORIZED TO INSTRUCT THE
COUNSELOR TO PERMIT DISCLOSURE AND THE WAIVER IS ADEQUATE TO PERMIT
DISCLOSURE, WE WOULD LIKE A FINDING UNDER THE EVIDENCE CODE OF 1037.5,
SUBSECTION (C) THAT THE COUNSELOR AND THE PROGRAM MAY NOT CLAIM THE
PRIVILEGE. THERE IS, I THINK, I SUBMIT, SOME AMBIGUITY IN THAT
PARTICULAR STATUTE. I THINK MS. BODIN AND I AGREE THAT THERE IS TWO
PARTS TO THAT SECTION. ONE PART SAYS THAT IF A VICTIM IS ALLEGED TO BE
DECEASED, THE COURT MAY HAVE AN IN CAMERA HEARING TO DETERMINE IF THE
DISCLOSURE CAN BE COMPELLED. IN ANOTHER SECTION, IT SAYS THAT IF THE
HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE IS DECEASED, THEN THE COUNSELOR MAY NOT CLAIM
THE PRIVILEGE. SO WE'RE WANTING YOUR HONOR TO MAKE A FINDING THAT THE
DOCUMENTS ATTACHED TO THE SUBPOENA ARE APPROPRIATE AND THAT THE
PRIVILEGE CANNOT BE CLAIMED BY THE COUNSELOR IF THAT IS THE CASE. IF
THAT IS THE CASE, THEN THE -- THEN DISCLOSURE MAY BE MADE. IN ADDITION
TO THAT, WE'RE ASKING FOR A MODIFICATION OF ONE OF THE REQUESTS BECAUSE
OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT WOULD REQUIRE AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH BY SOJOURN,
WHICH IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES.

*THE COURT:* WHAT MODIFICATION ARE YOU ASKING FOR?

*MS. WITHEY:* ITEM NO. 1 OF THE SUBPOENA ASKS FOR -- REQUESTS DOCUMENTS
FROM MARCH 1ST, 1977, WHICH IS WHEN SOJOURN BEGAN, TO JUNE 12, 1994. AND
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 3,000 CALLS A YEAR THAT COME INTO THIS SHELTER.
AND SO, THEREFORE, IF YOU DO THE ARITHMETIC, APPROXIMATELY 54,000
DOCUMENTS. NOW, THAT'S WHAT WAS REQUESTED. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT TO
MODIFY THIS. I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MR. DARDEN, WHO INDICATED THEY I
BELIEVE DID NOT HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO PROVIDING A REASONABLE COST TO AN
EMPLOYEE OF SOJOURN -- AND INDEED, IT HAS TO BE AN EMPLOYEE OF SOJOURN
BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE OF SOJOURN SEARCHING THROUGH
PRIVILEGED DOCUMENTS OBVIOUSLY -- BUT EMPLOYEE OF SOJOURN TO GO THROUGH
THE RECORDS AND AT A REASONABLE HOURLY RATE -- TYPICAL RATE FOR THE
ACTUAL EMPLOYEES THERE IS ABOUT $10 AN HOUR -- TO GO THROUGH AND SEARCH
THE DOCUMENTS FOR WHAT IS REQUESTED. AND WE WOULD BE -- WE WOULD DO THAT
IN COMPLIANCE WITH A COURT ORDER, ASSUMING THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN
FINDINGS WHICH YOUR HONOR MADE WITH REGARD TO THE PRIVILEGE INITIALLY.
THERE'S ALSO A REQUEST TO HAVE, IF YOUR HONOR COMPELS DISCLOSURE, A
REQUEST FOR AN IN CAMERA HEARING WITH REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE
DOCUMENTS THAT ARE --

*THE COURT:* PRODUCED?

*MS. WITHEY:* -- AVAILABLE. AND I DO NOT WANT TO -- AND I KNOW YOU CAN
APPRECIATE WHY I DO NOT WANT TO COMMENT UPON WHAT ARE IN THOSE DOCUMENTS
AT THIS TIME, EITHER BEFORE THE JURY IS SEQUESTERED OR BEFORE ANY IN
CAMERA HEARING. SO THAT IS OUR POSITION.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. MISS BODIN.

*MS. BODIN:* THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* GOOD MORNING.

*MS. BODIN:* GOOD MORNING. LYDIA BODIN REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE. COUNSEL
HAS SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE COURT TO MAKE FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO WHETHER
OR NOT THE PRIVILEGE CAN BE CLAIMED BY SOJOURN; AND I AM GOING TO ASK
THE COURT TO MAKE THE FINDING THAT SOJOURN IS NOT WHO IS THE PRIVILEGE
HOLDER. UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1037.5, IT SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELOR CANNOT CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE IF NO HOLDER IS
IN EXISTENCE. HOLDER IS FURTHER DEFINED IN EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1037.5
AS EITHER BEING, ONE, THE VICTIM, OR TWO, THE GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR.
NEITHER ONE OF THOSE ARE IN EXISTENCE. OBVIOUSLY THE VICTIM IS DECEASED
AND THERE IS NO GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR. SECONDLY, EVEN ASSUMING THAT
THE COURT IS ENTERTAINING THE IDEA THAT SOJOURN CAN CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE,
I BELIEVE THAT THE WAIVER THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN BY THE EXECUTOR OF THE
ESTATE, LOUIS BROWN, IS SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME ANY CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE.
THE -- IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE IS NOT
ONE OF THE HOLDERS OF THE PRIVILEGE AND ARGUABLY COULD NOT THEN WAIVE.
BUT IF THE COURT RECALLS THAT SECTION, I THINK THE COURT CAN MAKE AN
ANALOGY TO THE PRECEDING PRIVILEGE, WHICH IS THE SEXUAL ASSAULT
COUNSELOR PRIVILEGE, WHICH INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
COUNSELOR PRIVILEGE REFERENCES INTO, ALTHOUGH IT IS SILENT WITH REGARD
TO WHETHER OR NOT AN EXECUTOR CAN BE A PRIVILEGE HOLDER AS TO THE
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELOR PRIVILEGE.

*THE COURT:* THEN DON'T THE RULES OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION REQUIRE THAT
I ASSUME THAT SINCE THE LEGISLATURE MENTIONED OR ACKNOWLEDGED THE
EXISTENCE OF A SCHEME AND BY ITS ABSENCE IN THIS STATUTE CHOSE NOT TO
INCLUDE THAT? I MEAN DON'T I HAVE A ASSUME THAT UNDER THE CODE?

*MS. BODIN:* THAT IS A CONFUSING STATUTE. COUNSEL ALLUDED TO THAT. I
THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION BETWEEN 1937.2, WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE
PROCEDURE, THE IN CAMERA PROCEDURE, THAT THE COURT MAY FOLLOW ITS
OBVIOUS DISCRETION. THE LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE IS "MAY". IT'S NOT
"SHALL FOLLOW THIS PROCEDURE." IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IN THIS SECTION,
IT TALKS ABOUT THE IN CAMERA PROCEEDING. IT CITES NOT THE PROCEDURE FOR
THE SEXUAL ASSAULT PRIVILEGE. AND THAT PROCEDURE REQUIRES A BALANCING
TEST WHERE YOU TAKE THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN
THE RECORDS AND BALANCE THEM AGAINST THE EFFECT OF THE TREATMENT. THAT
ASSUMES A LIVING VICTIM. WE DON'T HAVE A LIVING VICTIM HERE. IT IS
CONFUSING, AND I THINK COUNSEL IS CORRECT IN REQUESTING THE COURT TO
MAKE CERTAIN FINDINGS. BUT I THINK THAT THE COURT WOULD NOT HAVE TO GET
TO MY SECOND AND THIRD ARGUMENTS I THINK MERELY BY THE TERMS OF THE
STATUTE. THEY CAN'T CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE AND, THEREFORE, THEY SHOULD TURN
OVER THE RECORDS.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MS. BODIN, HOW DO WE HANDLE THE PRACTICAL
OBJECTION THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH, POTENTIALLY HAVING TO SORT THROUGH
BETWEEN 50- AND 60,000 DOCUMENTS AND AN EMPLOYEE OF SOJOURN IS GOING TO
HAVE TO DO THIS, AND WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT.

*MS. BODIN:* INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, A BOARD MEMBER OF SOJOURN HAS
PUBLICLY MADE A STATEMENT WITH REGARD TO WHEN NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON MADE
A CONTACT WITH THE SOJOURN SHELTER NEARING THAT TIME TO RIGHT -- I
BELIEVE IT WAS THE LATE 1980'S. I THINK THAT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A
BEGINNING POINT FOR SOJOURN. THAT'S ALREADY BEEN PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED. SO
THEY HAVE A PLACE TO BEGIN.

*THE COURT:* BUT YOUR SDT ASKS FOR MARCH OF '77.

*MS. BODIN:* WE DID. AND WE HAVE AGREED IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNSEL
TO PAY BASICALLY A MINIMUM WAGE FOR SOMEBODY TO GO THROUGH THOSE RECORDS
AND LOOK IF THE COURT DEEMS THAT NECESSARY.

*THE COURT:* WELL, THEY'RE ASKING FOR 10 BUCKS AN HOUR, WHICH IS MORE
THAN TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE AS IT STANDS TODAY.

*MS. BODIN:* IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A RECORD CHECK IS A PRETTY SIMPLE
THING. I THINK IT SIMPLY COULD BE DESCRIBED TO THE PERSON LOOKING. I
THINK THAT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED FAIRLY RAPIDLY. I'M FAMILIAR WITH WHAT
LOGS LOOK LIKE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LOGS LOOK LIKE IN SHELTERS, AND
IT'S JUST MERELY LOOKING FOR A NAME. THAT'S ALL IT IS. AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S THAT MUCH WORK. I THINK IT'S TIME CONSUMING, BUT IT'S NOT DIFFICULT
WORK AND SOMETHING THAT WARRANTS $10 AN HOUR.

*THE COURT:* WELL, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR AND THAT'S WHAT THEY
PAY THEIR PEOPLE. SO --

*MS. WITHEY:* YOUR HONOR, WHAT I DID, I ASKED SOJOURN WHAT THEY PAY, FOR
EXAMPLE, A RECEPTIONIST, CLERK OR CLERICAL PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT ARGUING
OVER THAT, BUT THAT IS WHAT THEY DO PAY THEM. SO I THOUGHT WE WOULD ASK
FOR WHAT THEY ORDINARILY PAY THEIR PAID EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE MANY
NON-PAID EMPLOYEES, BUT PAID EMPLOYEES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS, MS. BODIN?

*MS. BODIN:* YOUR HONOR, I JUST SPOKE TO MR. DARDEN. WE WOULD BE WILLING
TO GO AS HIGH AS $7 OR $8.00. IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES.

*MS. WITHEY:* THAT'S FINE, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ANY OTHER COMMENT, MS. WITHEY?

*MS. WITHEY:* NO, YOUR HONOR. I REQUEST THAT YOU MAKE THE SPECIFIC
FINDINGS THAT ARE SUPPORTED IN OUR PAPERS.

*THE COURT:* AT THIS TIME THEN, THE COURT WILL MAKE A FINDING THAT THE
TRUSTEE OF THE ESTATE OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, LOUIS BROWN, IS
AUTHORIZED TO INSTRUCT THE COUNSELOR IN THE PROGRAM TO PERMIT
DISCLOSURE. THE COURT FURTHER MAKES A FINDING THAT THE WAIVER THAT IS
ATTACHED TO THE ORIGINAL SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM, WHICH IS EXECUTED BY
LOUIS BROWN, IS A WAIVER FOR THE PURPOSES OF DISCLOSING THE INFORMATION
SOUGHT BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, AND THE COURT FINDS THAT THE
COUNSELOR AND PROGRAM MAY NOT CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE UNDER THE MANNER IN
WHICH THE STATUTE IS INTERPRETED AS ARGUED BY THE PEOPLE. THE COURT WILL
FURTHER ORDER THAT ANY DOCUMENTS PRODUCED BY THE SOJOURN PROGRAM WILL BE
TRANSMITTED UNDER SEAL TO THIS COURT FOR THE COURT'S IN CAMERA REVIEW
AND THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE REIMBURSE THE SOJOURN PROGRAM
FOR THE COST AND EXPENSES OF THE DOCUMENT SEARCH AND PRODUCTION, NOT
INCLUDING COUNSEL FEES.

*MS. WITHEY:* THANKS. NO COUNSEL FEES.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, WHAT I WOULD PROPOSE WE DO THEN IS CALENDAR THE
MATTER FOR A PROGRESS REPORT SOMETIME SOON. MS. WITHEY, DO YOU HAVE ANY
GUESS AS TO HOW LONG THIS IS GOING TO TAKE?

*MS. WITHEY:* WELL, YOUR HONOR, MY CLIENTS ARE IN THE BUILDING PURSUANT
TO THE SUBPOENA. THEY HAVE BROUGHT CERTAIN DOCUMENTS WITH THEM. THERE
ARE OTHER DOCUMENTS OF COURSE THEY NEED TO NOW SEARCH FOR. AND SO THOSE
ARE AVAILABLE HERE TODAY. THE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS PURSUANT TO THE
SEARCH THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED COULD BE -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TIME FRAME
WOULD BE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH AND SEARCH IT. I WOULD THINK
10 DAYS, WOULD YOU SAY? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR TIME FRAME IS, BUT SAY 15
DAYS.

*THE COURT:* WE'RE HERE ALL DAY EVERY DAY.

*MS. WITHEY:* OKAY. GIVE THEM 15 DAYS TO SEARCH FOR THE DOCUMENTS, THE
ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS. WE DO HAVE SOME INITIAL DOCUMENTS WHICH YOUR HONOR
CAN REVIEW IN CAMERA TODAY.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MS. WITHEY, WHAT IS THE VOLUME OF THE MATERIAL
YOU HAVE TODAY?

*MS. WITHEY:* VERY SMALL. IT'S VERY EASILY REVIEWED. JUST A COUPLE PAGES.

*THE COURT:* WOULD YOU HAVE YOUR CLIENT THEN PRODUCE THOSE IN COURT TODAY?

*MS. WITHEY:* THEY'RE ON ANOTHER FLOOR OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE. I WILL HAVE TO GO GET THEM AND BRING THEM BACK HERE. I CAN DO
THAT. MR. DARDEN, IF YOU WOULD.

*THE COURT:* PERHAPS WE COULD ACCOMPLISH THAT BY A PHONE CALL.

*MS. WITHEY:* HE'S MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE WITNESSES BROUGHT UP.
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THEM BRIEFLY BEFORE SO I CAN ADVISE THEM OF
YOUR HONOR'S RULING AND THE NATURE OF THE SITUATION.

*THE COURT:* THEN IF YOUR CLIENTS ARE HERE, THEN IT WOULD BE MY
INCLINATION TO CONDUCT THE IN CAMERA REVIEW THIS MORNING.

*MS. WITHEY:* THAT'S FINE.

*THE COURT:* AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

*MS. WITHEY:* THAT'S FINE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THERE MAY BE
ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS.

*THE COURT:* MIGHT AS WELL GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY SINCE THEY'RE HERE.

*MS. WITHEY:* I THINK THAT'S PERFECT. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ANY OTHER MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS WE NEED TO TAKE UP BEFORE
WE -- BEFORE THE COURT ADJOURNS FOR THE IN CAMERA REVIEW?

*MR. COCHRAN:* I WOULD LIKE TO APPROACH AGAIN WITH MR. HODGMAN.

*THE COURT:* SURE.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. ALL RIGHT. MS. WITHEY,
AGAIN, GOOD MORNING.

*MS. WITHEY:* YES. MY CLIENTS ARE PRESENT WITH THE DOCUMENTS, AND WE
REQUEST AN IN CAMERA HEARING AS WE DISCUSSED.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THEN, COUNSEL, WE WILL THEN STAND IN RECESS. THE
COURT WILL INVITE COUNSEL FOR THE PROGRAM, THE TWO PROGRAM
REPRESENTATIVES -- AND COULD WE HAVE THEM PLEASE STAND AND GIVE THEIR
NAMES FOR THE RECORD, PLEASE.

*MS. HAFNER:* HOLLY HAFNER.

*MS. NEY:* NANCY NEY.

*THE COURT:* COULD YOU SPELL YOUR NAMES, PLEASE?

*MS. HAFNER:* H-A-F-N-E-R.

*THE COURT:* AND HOLLY IS WITH A "Y"?

*MS. HAFNER:* YES.

*MS. NEY:* LAST NAME NEY, N-E-Y.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, THEN WE'LL STAND IN RECESS. AND, COUNSEL, WOULD
YOU BRING YOU AND YOUR CLIENTS AND THEIR MATERIALS INTO CHAMBERS, PLEASE.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD IN CHAMBERS, TRANSCRIBED AND SEALED UNDER
SEPARATE COVER.)

(PAGES 10530 THROUGH 10541, VOLUME 68A, TRANSCRIBED AND SEALED UNDER
SEPARATE COVER.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. MR.
SIMPSON IS AGAIN PRESENT WITH COUNSEL, MR. SHAPIRO, MR. COCHRAN, MR.
BAILEY, MR. UELMEN, PEOPLE REPRESENTED BY MISS BODIN, MR. DARDEN. ALSO
PRESENT IS MS. WITHEY ON BEHALF OF SOJOURN. COUNSEL, THE COURT HAS
CONDUCTED AN IN CAMERA REVIEW OF TWO DOCUMENTS BROUGHT TO COURT BY THE
SOJOURN PROGRAM. I HAVE REVIEWED BOTH DOCUMENTS, AND I FIND THEM TO BE
MATERIAL TO THE ISSUES AND FACTS REGARDING THIS CASE; AND I'M GOING TO
ORDER THEIR PRODUCTION IN COURT. COUNSEL HAS COMPLIED BY GIVING THE
COURT A PHOTOCOPY OF BOTH DOCUMENTS AND EXTENDING TO THE COURT THE
ORIGINALS OF THOSE DOCUMENTS. MS. WITHEY, I'M GOING TO ORDER THAT YOU,
AS COUNSEL FOR THE PROGRAM, MAINTAIN COPY -- PHYSICAL CUSTODY OF THE
ORIGINALS. I'M GOING TO DISSEMINATE ONE PHOTOCOPY TO EACH COUNSEL,
COUNSEL FOR EACH SIDE, WITH THE FOLLOWING ORDER: THIS IS NOT TO BE
PHOTOCOPIED, IT IS NOT TO BE DISSEMINATED IN ANY WAY AND IS NOT TO BE
DISCUSSED PUBLICLY EXCEPT FOR ON THE RECORD HERE IN COURT SHOULD THAT
BECOME NECESSARY. SOJOURN IS ALSO ORDERED NOT TO DISSEMINATE ANY COPIES
OF THIS OR NOT TO PUBLICLY DISCUSS THE CONTENTS OF THIS DOCUMENT UNTIL
FURTHER ORDER OF THE COURT. ALL RIGHT. ANY QUESTIONS AS TO THAT ISSUE?
ALL RIGHT. LET ME SEE MS. BODIN AND MR. SHAPIRO.

*MS. WITHEY:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MS. WITHEY, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO
DISCUSS WITH THE COURT? OTHERWISE, WE WILL STAND IN RECESS AS TO YOUR
MATTERS.

*MS. WITHEY:* THANK YOU. THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.

*THE COURT:* THEN YOU AND YOUR CLIENTS ARE EXCUSED.

*MS. WITHEY:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU, LADIES.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO REVIEW THOSE
DOCUMENTS AND DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR CLIENT?

*MR. SHAPIRO:* YES, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WE'LL STAND IN RECESS FOR 15.

(RECESS.)

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. MR.
SIMPSON IS AGAIN PRESENT WITH MR. SHAPIRO, MR. COCHRAN, MR. BAILEY, MR.
UELMEN, PEOPLE REPRESENTED BY MR. GORDON, MS. BODIN AND MR. GOLDBERG. I
HAVE TO HAVE A LIST UP HERE OF ALL THE LAWYERS. ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, THE
NEXT MATTER ON THE COURT'S AGENDA FOR THIS MORNING IS THE DEFENSE MOTION
IN LIMINE REGARDING 1101(B) TYPE EVIDENCE. MR. UELMEN.

*MR. UELMEN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. YOUR HONOR, AT THE OUTSET OF THIS
MOTION, SINCE IT WILL INVOLVE THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE TESTIMONY OF A
NUMBER OF WITNESSES WHO WILL POSSIBLY APPEAR TO TESTIFY AT THE TRIAL, WE
WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT THOSE WITNESSES BE EXCLUDED FROM THIS HEARING. WE
BELIEVE THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DANGER OF THE ARGUMENT ON THIS MOTION
AFFECTING THEIR TESTIMONY AT TRIAL AND BELIEVE THAT FOR PURPOSES OF A
PRETRIAL MOTION, THERE IS NO RIGHT FOR THE WITNESSES TO BE PRESENT WHILE
THE ARGUMENT TAKES PLACE.

*THE COURT:* MR. DARDEN.

*MR. DARDEN:* YOUR HONOR, THE PEOPLE WOULD OBJECT TO THE EXCLUSION OF
ANY MEMBER OF THE BROWN FAMILY. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT
INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THIS CASE. THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN HEARING
THE TRUTH AND LEARNING THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING AND LEADING TO THE
DEATH OF THEIR DAUGHTER AND SISTER. HAVING ALREADY SUFFERED THE DEATH OF
A DAUGHTER AND SISTER AT THE HANDS OF THE DEFENDANT, I DOUBT THAT THERE
IS ANYTHING THAT WILL OCCUR IN THIS COURT TODAY OR OVER THE NEXT COUPLE
OF DAYS THAT CAN AFFECT THEM ANY MORE THAN WHAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.
FURTHERMORE, THEY'VE ALL BEEN INTERVIEWED FOR THE MOST PART; THAT IS,
THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO BE TESTIFYING AT TRIAL. THE INTERVIEWS WERE
TAPED. COUNSEL HAS TRANSCRIPTS. I THINK THEIR POSITIONS ARE ALREADY SET
IN STONE VIRTUALLY.

*THE COURT:* ARE THERE ANY -- DO YOU INTEND ON CALLING ANY MEMBERS OF
THE BROWN FAMILY AS WITNESSES AT TRIAL?

*MR. DARDEN:* YES, YOUR HONOR. WE INTEND TO CALL JUDITHA BROWN, NICOLE
BROWN'S MOTHER, WE INTEND TO CALL DENISE BROWN, AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE
WILL BE CALLING ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE FAMILY AT THIS POINT, NOT IN OUR
CASE IN CHIEF.

*THE COURT:* I SEE ONLY DENISE BROWN IN THE COURTROOM TODAY.

*MR. DARDEN:* THAT'S CORRECT. MRS. BROWN ISN'T HERE TODAY.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. UELMEN.

*MR. UELMEN:* YOUR HONOR --

*MR. DARDEN:* I'M SORRY. WE INTEND TO CALL DOMINIQUE BROWN ALSO, AND SHE
IS PRESENT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. UELMEN:* WHAT WE'RE HERE TO LITIGATE IS WHETHER MR. SIMPSON
COMMITTED THESE MURDERS AND TO PREMISE THE OPPOSITION TO THIS MOTION ON
THE ASSUMPTION THAT THAT IS IN FACT -- WHAT TOOK PLACE IS UNWARRANTED.
WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HERE IS NOT THE INTEREST OF ANY PARTICULAR
WITNESS OR FAMILY MEMBER IN THIS CASE, BUT THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE AND
THE RIGHT OF THE DEFENDANT TO ENSURE THAT THE WITNESSES WHO ARE
TESTIFYING WILL NOT BE INFECTED BY THEIR PRESENCE IN PROCEEDINGS THAT
RELATE DIRECTLY TO THE SUBSTANCE OF THEIR TESTIMONY. I MEAN THE
WITNESSES WHO MR. DARDEN HAS ENUMERATED ARE THE VERY WITNESSES WHOSE
TESTIMONY WE'RE GOING TO BE ARGUING ABOUT IN TERMS OF ITS ADMISSIBILITY.
AND I THINK IT'S A LEGITIMATE AND FAIR CONCERN OF ANY DEFENDANT IN A
CRIMINAL CASE THAT THOSE WITNESSES NOT BE INFECTED BY, IN EFFECT,
LISTENING TO THE ARGUMENTS THAT NORMALLY WOULD TAKE PLACE OUT OF THE
HEARING OF ANYONE AT A BENCH CONFERENCE. WHAT A MOTION IN LIMINE IS IS
SIMPLY A DEVICE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE COURT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY START THE PROCESS OF A JURY TRIAL. THESE ARE
OBJECTIONS THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE HEARD AT THE BENCH, AND WITNESSES OF
ANY SORT WOULD NOT BE PARTY TO LISTEN IN TO THOSE PROCEEDINGS; AND
THAT'S THE ONLY CONCERN THAT WE HAVE, THAT THEIR TESTIMONY WILL NOT BE
INFECTED.

*THE COURT:* MR. UELMEN, LET ME ASK YOU THIS: DO YOU HAVE ANY STATUTORY
OR CASE LAW AUTHORITY FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT THE COURT SHOULD OR CAN
EXCLUDE INTERESTED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS TYPE
OF IN LIMINE MOTION HEARING?

*MR. UELMEN:* WELL, YES, YOUR HONOR. WE WOULD RELY, FIRST OF ALL, ON
1102.6 I BELIEVE OF THE PENAL CODE, WHICH ADDRESSES SPECIFICALLY THE
RIGHT OF VICTIMS TO BE PRESENT DURING A TRIAL, ASSUMING THAT THIS IS
PART OF THE TRIAL. WE DO HAVE AN ON-GOING TRIAL HERE. AND THAT STATUTE
DEFINES "VICTIMS" TO INCLUDE MEMBERS OF THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY AND ALLOWS
THE DEFENSE TO INSIST THAT THEY WILL BE CALLED AS THE FIRST WITNESSES
BEFORE ANY OTHER TESTIMONY IS HEARD. SO THAT IS A STATUTORY ATTEMPT TO
ACCOMMODATE THE CONCERN THAT WE'RE EXPRESSING ABOUT WITNESSES HEARING
TESTIMONY OF THOSE BEFORE THEM BEFORE THEY ARE PERMITTED TO TESTIFY, AND
THEN OF COURSE WITHIN THE EVIDENCE CODE ITSELF, I BELIEVE IT IS SECTION
3 --

*THE COURT:* MAYBE 777?

*MR. UELMEN:* 777. YES, YOUR HONOR. -- WITH RESPECT TO THE EXCLUSION OF
WITNESSES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. DARDEN, ANY RESPONSE TO THAT?

*MR. DARDEN:* YOUR HONOR, THE COURT HAS DISCRETION, I THINK, TO EXCLUDE
WITNESSES OR TO ALLOW WITNESSES TO REMAIN, TO REMAIN IN COURT. AND I'M
SURE THE COURT IS AWARE ALSO OF A RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO THE
PENAL CODE THAT GRANTS VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME THE SAME RIGHTS AS
DEFENDANTS AS IT RELATES TO THEIR RIGHTS TO BE PRESENT IN COURT. I THINK
IT WOULD BE A GRAVE INJUSTICE, AN INSULT TO THE FAMILY TO EXCLUDE THEM
FROM THIS HEARING OR ANY HEARING OR ANY PORTION OF THE TRIAL IN THIS
MATTER. THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST AND EXTREME INTEREST IN THESE
PROCEEDINGS AND THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY. WHO HAS A GREATER
INTEREST? WHO HAS SUFFERED A GREATER LOSS THAN THE GOLDMAN FAMILY AND
THE BROWN FAMILY? THE COURT HAS DISCRETION, AND WE WOULD URGE THE COURT
TO ALLOW THE BROWN FAMILY TO REMAIN DURING THESE PROCEEDINGS.

*MR. UELMEN:* YOUR HONOR, I WANT TO OBJECT TO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF
THIS MOTION AS INSULT TO ANY WITNESS. THIS IS A RULE THAT APPLIES TO
EVERY WITNESS REGARDLESS OF WHAT INTEREST THEY HAVE IN THE CASE, AND IT
IS NOT AN INSULT TO THAT WITNESS TO TELL THEM THAT THEY MAY NOT APPEAR
IN THE COURTROOM UNTIL THEY HAVE TESTIFIED. THAT IS A STANDARD RULE TO
PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE
TESTIMONY OF EVERY WITNESS, REGARDLESS OF WHAT INTEREST THEY HAVE IN THE
CASE.

*MR. DARDEN:* WELL, IT IS AN INSULT. I'M OFFENDED BY IT AND I'M SURE THE
VICTIMS' FAMILIES ARE OFFENDED BY THE REQUEST. THERE IS NO PREJUDICE
THAT CAN ACCRUE TO THIS DEFENDANT BY HAVING THESE WITNESSES, THESE
VICTIMS, THESE FAMILY MEMBERS REMAIN IN COURT DURING THESE PROCEEDINGS.
THERE'S NO GOOD REASON TO EXCLUDE THEM.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. ALL RIGHT. EVIDENCE CODE
SECTION 777 ALLOWS THE COURT TO EXCLUDE FROM THE COURTROOM ANY WITNESS
NOT AT THE TIME UNDER EXAMINATION SO THAT SUCH WITNESS DOES NOT HEAR THE
TESTIMONY OF OTHER WITNESSES. EXCLUSION OF WITNESSES PERTAINS TO THE
ACTUAL TAKING OF TESTIMONY AND NOT ARGUMENT. THE MOTION TO EXCLUDE WILL
BE DENIED AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT. MR. UELMEN.

*MR. UELMEN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. WHILE, AS YOUR HONOR IS CERTAINLY
WELL AWARE, THIS IS A MOTION THAT COVERS A GOOD DEAL OF POTENTIAL
TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE AT THIS TRIAL, I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
OVERRIDING GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES, ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE
ADMISSIBILITY OF CHARACTER EVIDENCE, RELATED TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF
EVIDENCE OF EXPERTS, RELATED TO PARTICULAR SYNDROMES AND RELATED TO THE
HEARSAY RULE AND ITS EXCEPTIONS THAT WILL HELP US CUT THROUGH MANY OF
THE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS AND PERHAPS SET SOME GENERAL GUIDELINES THAT
WILL ASSIST THE COURT IN ADDRESSING ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE. AS I READ THE
PEOPLE'S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT'S MOTION IN LIMINE, IT REMINDED ME OF
MY OWN BRIEF BUT STELLAR CAREER AS A PROSECUTOR. I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE
ORGANIZED CRIME DIVISION OF THE OFFICE, AND THAT IS WHERE I FIRST
ENCOUNTERED THE POWER OF THE LABELS THAT WE PUT ON CRIMINAL CASES. WE
ACTUALLY HAD A RUBBER STAMP THAT WE WOULD STAMP ON THE FILES "ORGANIZED
CRIME DIVISION" IN THREE-INCH LETTERS. AND WHEN WE MARKED A NEW CARD, WE
WERE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS EXPOSED SO THAT EVERYBODY
KNEW THIS WAS AN ORGANIZED CRIME CASE. AND IT TRANSFORMED THE
PROCEEDINGS. THE DEFENDANT SUDDENLY BECAME MORE SINISTER. THE DEFENSE
LAWYERS BECAME MORE MENACING. AND PROSECUTORS OF COURSE ARE WELL AWARE
OF THE POWER OF LABELS. TODAY OF COURSE, WE DON'T NECESSARILY RELY ON
RUBBER STAMPS. WE HAVE 35-INCH VIDEO SCREENS TO PUT LABELS ON CASES. BUT
THE LABEL THAT THE PROSECUTION WANTS TO PUT ON THIS CASE IS ANNOUNCED IN
THEIR RESPONSE TO THE MOTION AT PAGE 3 WHEN THEY SAY IN SHORT, "THIS IS
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE INVOLVING MURDER, NOT A MURDER CASE INVOLVING
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE." AND BY ATTACHING THAT LABEL, BY SAYING THIS CASE IS
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE, THEY SEEK TO TRANSFORM THESE PROCEEDINGS FROM
AN INQUIRY INTO WHO KILLED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD GOLDMAN ON
JUNE 12TH, 1994 INTO A GENERAL INQUIRY INTO THE CHARACTER OF O.J.
SIMPSON IN WHICH HE WILL BE CALLED UPON TO EXPLAIN EVERY ASPECT OF HIS
LIFE FOR 17 YEARS. AND THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH WHAT THE
PROSECUTION IS TRYING TO DO HERE. I THINK THAT PROBLEM WAS SUMMONED UP
BY WHAT JUDGE MEDKA (PHONETIC), NOW WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, STATED IN THE
CASE OF UNITED STATES VERSUS BAESKE WHEN HE SERVED ON THE DISTRICT OF
COLOMBIA COURT OF APPEALS IN 1980. HE SAID:

"IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE THAT A DEFENDANT MUST BE
TRIED FOR WHAT HE DID, NOT FOR WHO HE IS." NOW, WE HAVE AN UNUSUAL
DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE IN TERMS OF A DEFENDANT BEGINNING WITH A
RESERVOIR OF PUBLIC REGARD, A GOOD REPUTATION, AND WE'VE SEEN THE IMPACT
OF A PUBLIC CAMPAIGN TO CHANGE THAT. WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT
CAMPAIGN BEING BROUGHT INTO THIS COURTROOM UNDER THE GUISE OF EVIDENCE
OF BAD CHARACTER. AND THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE ADHERES TO SOME VERY
IMPORTANT GENERAL RULES TO EFFECTUATE THAT GENERAL PRINCIPAL THAT
SOMEONE SHOULD BE TRIED FOR WHAT HE DID RATHER THAN WHO HE IS; AND THAT
RULE QUITE SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT A DEFENDANT CANNOT BE CONVICTED BY
SHOWING HIS BAD CHARACTER OR PROTENSITY TO COMMIT CRIME. THAT IS OF
COURSE EMBODIED IN SECTION 1101(A) OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, WHICH PROVIDES:

"EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION AND SECTIONS 1102 AND 1103, EVIDENCE
OF A PERSON'S CHARACTER OR A TRAIT OF HIS OR HER CHARACTER, WHETHER IN
THE FORM OF AN OPINION, EVIDENCE OF REPUTATION OR EVIDENCE OF SPECIFIC
INSTANCES OF HIS OR HER CONDUCT IS INADMISSIBLE WHEN OFFERED TO PROVE
HIS OR HER CONDUCT ON A SPECIFIED OCCASION." NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK
TO NOTE WHERE IN THE EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1101 APPEARS. IT APPEARS IN
PROVISION 9, WHICH IS HEADED, "EVIDENCE AFFECTED OR EXCLUDED BY
INTRINSIC POLICIES." THIS EVIDENCE IS KEPT OUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S STRICTLY
IRRELEVANT, THAT IT WOULD OFFER NO ASSISTANCE TO THE RESOLUTION OF
FACTUAL ISSUES. IN FACT, WE'RE TOLD IN THE SAME PROVISIONS OF THE
EVIDENCE CODE THAT THE DEFENDANT, IF HE CHOOSES, CAN PRESENT EVIDENCE OF
GOOD CHARACTER. AND AS YOUR HONOR IS AWARE, A STANDARD JURY INSTRUCTION
INFORMS THE JURY THAT EVIDENCE OF GOOD CHARACTER ITSELF CAN RAISE A
REASONABLE DOUBT. SO IT'S NOT THAT CHARACTER EVIDENCE BY ITSELF HAS NO
RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER. THE REASON FOR THIS RULE OF EXCLUSION IS BECAUSE
THIS EVIDENCE IS SO LIKELY TO BE MISUSED, TO BE USED FOR THE WRONG
PURPOSE, TO BE GIVEN GREATER WEIGHT THAN IT TRULY DESERVES. SO AT THE
OUTSET, I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO ASK WHAT ARE THE INTRINSIC POLICIES THAT
ARE SERVED BY SECTION 1101(A) AND ITS EXCLUSIONARY RULE. AND THE BEST
SUMMARY I GUESS OF THE INTRINSIC POLICIES THAT UNDERLAY SECTION 1101 WAS
OFFERED BY JUSTICE FRANK RICHARDSON OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT, WHO
HAS A WELL-DESERVED REPUTATION FOR GETTING RIGHT TO THE POINT WITH
PRECISION, AND HE CERTAINLY DID SO IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS THOMAS,
20 CAL. 3D 457 AT 464. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT
UNDERLAY SECTION 1101:

"AS WE EXPLAINED IN CRAMER AND KELLY, THE PURPOSES OF THE FOREGOING
EXCLUSIONARY RULE ARE THREEFOLD.

"ONE, TO AVOID PLACING THE ACCUSED IN A POSITION IN WHICH HE MUST DEFEND
AGAINST UNCHARGED OFFENSES.

"SECONDLY, TO GUARD AGAINST THE PROBABILITY THAT EVIDENCE OF SUCH
UNCHARGED ACTS WOULD PREJUDICE DEFENDANT IN THE MINDS OF THE JURORS;

"AND THIRD, TO PROMOTE JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY BY RESTRICTING PROOF OF
EXTRANEOUS CRIMES." IN BRIEF, HE CONCLUDED:

"ALTHOUGH DEFENDANT'S PRIOR CRIMINAL ACTS MAY DEMONSTRATE HIS BAD
CHARACTER AND HIS PROPENSITY OR DISPOSITION TO COMMIT THE CRIME CHARGED,
A DEFENDANT IS NOT TO BE CONVICTED BECAUSE THE PROSECUTION CAN PROVE ON
HIS PRIOR RECORD THAT HE IS A BAD MAN." NOW, EACH OF THESE POLICIES THAT
JUSTICE RICHARDSON ENUMERATED IS OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO THIS MOTION
AND THIS CASE. FIRST OF ALL, THE PROBLEM OF PUTTING THE ACCUSED IN THE
POSITION OF HAVING TO DEFEND AGAINST UNCHARGED CONDUCT. NOW, BY THE
INFORMATION FILED IN THIS CASE AFTER THE PRELIMINARY HEARING IN JUNE,
MR. SIMPSON WAS PUT ON NOTICE THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DEFEND AGAINST A
CHARGE THAT HE MURDERED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD GOLDMAN ON JUNE
12TH, 1994. NEARLY EACH WEEK SINCE THEN, THE BREATH OF THE CASE HAS
EXPANDED CALLS UPON MR. SIMPSON TO SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE TO EXPLAIN EVENTS
THAT TOOK PLACE MANY YEARS AGO. AND JUST ON MONDAY OF THIS WEEK, THE
PROSECUTORS FILED AN ADDENDUM TO THEIR RESPONSE TO THIS MOTION
SUGGESTING THEY WOULD OFFER EVIDENCE OF NEIGHBORS WHO LIVED IN AN
APARTMENT NEXT DOOR TO MR. SIMPSON IN 1977, 1978, AND WHO HEARD LOUD
ARGUMENTS. WE WERE TOLD THAT MR. SIMPSON WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE
REPORT OF A FOOTBALL FAN WHO CLAIMS THAT HE SAW MR. SIMPSON ON THE BEACH
IN 1986 OR 1987 STRIKING A FEMALE COMPANION. NOW, TRY TO IMAGINE WHAT IT
IS LIKE TO BE ON TRIAL IN A CASE LIKE THIS WHERE THE CHARGES GROW AS
FAST AS THE TABLOIDS CAN SUPPLY NEW FODDER. IT IS TRULY KAFKAESQUE. YOUR
HONOR COMPILED A LIST WITH A TOTAL OF 59 SEPARATE ITEMS WHICH ARE NOW IN
ISSUE, AND THE LIST KEEPS GROWING, AND THAT'S A CONCERN. IT'S A CONCERN
TO ANY DEFENDANT AND IT'S A CONCERN ADDRESSED BY SECTION 1101 WHEN, AS
JUSTICE RICHARDSON PUT IT, WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT PUTTING THE
ACCUSED IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO DEFEND AGAINST CONDUCT WHICH IS NOT
CHARGED, WHICH IS SIMPLY BEING ADDED TO THE CHARGES. AND I THINK IT'S
QUITE IRONIC THAT MUCH OF THE CONDUCT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING
ABOUT COULDN'T BE CHARGED EVEN IF THE PROSECUTION WANTED TO BECAUSE THE
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS HAS LONG ELAPSED, AND IT'S IRONIC THAT THIS CAN
BE DRAGGED IN AS KIND OF A CABOOSE TO A SEPARATE TRIAL RELATING TO
CHARGED CONDUCT. THE SECOND POLICY THAT JUSTICE RICHARDSON MENTIONED IS
TO GUARD AGAINST THE PROBABILITY OF PREJUDICE. AND THE POSSIBILITY OF
PREJUDICE IN THIS CASE IS NOT ONLY REAL; IT IS MEASURABLE. I THINK THE
MOST SOPHISTICATED EFFECT OR EFFORT TO MEASURE THE POTENTIAL PREJUDICE
OF THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE WAS THE CLASSIC STUDY OF JURY BEHAVIOR BY
PROFESSORS CALVIN AND SIDEL, IN WHICH AFTER STUDYING A WHOLE SPECTRUM OF
JURY TRIALS, THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE RATE OF ACQUITTAL BY JURIES DROPPED
FROM 42 PERCENT TO 25 PERCENT SIMPLY UPON LEARNING THAT THE DEFENDANT
HAD A PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD. I THINK YOU CAN ALSO JUST LOOK AT THE
IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC OPINION POLLS IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF
MR. SIMPSON'S GUILT BEFORE AND AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE 911 TAPES BACK
IN JUNE AND JULY, A VERY MEASURABLE PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT SHOWING THAT THE
IMPACT THAT THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE HAS IS FAR IN EXCESS OF THE WEIGHT
THAT IT SHOULD BE ACCORDED. IN THE MOST RECENT EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE
MYRIAD OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE ADMISSION OF THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE,
PEOPLE VERSUS EWOLDT, DECIDED IN FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR BY THE CALIFORNIA
SUPREME COURT, JUSTICE GEORGE NOTED THE SPECIAL DANGER OF PREJUDICE
WHERE THE PRIOR CONDUCT WAS NOT THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL CONVICTION.
AND I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT ONLY ONE OF THE PRIOR INCIDENTS THAT
THE PROSECUTION WILL SEEK TO UTILIZE IN THIS CASE ACTUALLY WAS LITIGATED
AND ENDED IN A CONVICTION BASED ON MR. SIMPSON'S PLEA OF NO CONTEST.
JUSTICE GEORGE POINTED OUT IN EWOLDT:

"THE PREJUDICIAL EFFECT OF THIS EVIDENCE IS HEIGHTENED BY THE
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT DEFENDANT'S UNCHARGED ACTS DID NOT RESULT IN CRIMINAL
CONVICTIONS.

"THIS CIRCUMSTANCE INCREASED THE DANGER THAT THE JURY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
INCLINED TO PUNISH THE DEFENDANT FOR UNCHARGED OFFENSES REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER IT CONSIDERED HIM GUILTY OF THE CHARGED OFFENSE AND INCREASED
LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSING THE ISSUES BECAUSE THE JURY HAD TO DETERMINE
WHETHER THE UNCHARGED OFFENSES HAD IN FACT OCCURRED." THE THIRD POLICY
THAT JUSTICE RICHARDSON LAID OUT FOR US WAS THE PROMOTION OF JUDICIAL
EFFICIENCY BY RESTRICTING THE PROOF OF EXTRANEOUS CRIMES. EACH OF THE
INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT IN THE COURSE
OF THIS MOTION WILL REQUIRE A MINI TRIAL IN ITSELF. I CAN ASSURE THE
COURT THAT THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERY ONE OF THESE ALLEGED INCIDENTS.
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE WITNESSES WHO ARE PRESENTING THESE INCIDENTS WILL
ITSELF BE SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE. IN MANY CASES, THE WITNESSES HAVE
ALREADY EXHIBITED BIAS BY PUBLICLY ANNOUNCING THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS WITH
RESPECT TO THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF THE DEFENDANT. MEMORIES ABOUT THESE
INCIDENTS WILL DIFFER WIDELY AS WE REACH FURTHER BACK, IN SOME CASES, TO
EVENTS 17 YEARS AGO; AND THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THIS EVIDENCE WILL
FREQUENTLY RAISE A 403 QUESTION UNDER THE EVIDENCE CODE, A PRELIMINARY
ISSUE OF FACT THAT RELATES TO THE RELEVANCY OF THE EVIDENCE REQUIRING
THE COURT TO ACTUALLY MAKE A DETERMINATION IN ADVANCE WITH RESPECT TO
THE RELEVANCY OF THE EVIDENCE AND THEN INSTRUCTING THE JURY THAT THEY
NEED TO DISREGARD IT IF THEY FIND THAT IN FACT THESE INCIDENTS DID NOT
OCCUR. AND THERE WILL BE VERY COMPLEX JURY INSTRUCTIONS REQUIRED WITH
RESPECT TO EACH OF THESE INCIDENTS. SO CERTAINLY THE PROMOTION OF
JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY WILL BE FURNISHED BY RESTRICTING PROOF OF EXTRANEOUS
CRIMES AND DEMANDING THAT THIS CASE REALLY FOCUS ON THE EVENTS OF WHAT
ACTUALLY HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH RATHER THAN REACHING BACK. NOW, THERE ARE
OF COURSE FOUR VERY CAREFULLY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS TO SECTION 1101(A), AND
THREE OF THOSE EXCEPTIONS ARE WHERE THE DEFENDANT HIMSELF CHOOSES
HIMSELF TO PUT CHARACTER IN ISSUE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE DEFENDANT CHOOSES
TO OFFER EVIDENCE OF GOOD CHARACTER, THAT EVIDENCE CAN OF COURSE BE
REBUTTED BY THE PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1102 AND THEY CAN PRESENT
EVIDENCE OF BAD CHARACTER RELATING TO THE SAME TRAITS OF CHARACTER.
SECONDLY, IF A DEFENDANT OFFERS EVIDENCE OF THE VIOLENT CHARACTER OF A
VICTIM IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN A CLAIM OF SELF-DEFENSE, THE PROSECUTION CAN
THEN PUT IN ISSUE THE DEFENDANT'S OWN REPUTATION FOR VIOLENCE. BUT
AGAIN, IT'S BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT HAS OPENED THE DOOR BY CHALLENGING THE
CHARACTER OF THE VICTIM. HE THEN INVITES A CHALLENGE TO HIS OWN
CHARACTER. AND THAT OF COURSE WILL NOT TAKE PLACE IN THIS TRIAL.
THIRDLY, IF THE DEFENDANT TESTIFIES, THE DEFENDANT OF COURSE PUTS HIS
OWN CHARACTER FOR TRUTH AND VERACITY IN ISSUE. HE CAN BE IMPEACHED THE
SAME AS ANY OTHER WITNESS UNDER SECTION 780 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, AND
EVIDENCE THAT REBUTS HIS FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS IN THE COURSE OF HIS
TESTIMONY MAY BE PRESENTED IN REBUTTAL. FINALLY -- AND THIS IS THE
CATEGORY OF EXCEPTION THAT I THINK WE WILL BE FOCUSING OUR ATTENTION ON
TODAY -- IF THE EVIDENCE OF CHARACTER OF SPECIFIC INSTANCES, SPECIFIC
ACTS IS RELEVANT TO PROVE A FACT OTHER THAN PROPENSITY BASED ON THE
SIMILARITY OF THE ACT, THAT BECAUSE THE PRIOR ACT IS SIMILAR TO THE
CRIME THAT WE ARE LITIGATING IN THIS CASE, WE CAN INFER THAT BOTH ACTS
WERE DONE WITH THE SAME MOTIVE OR BOTH ACTS WERE DONE WITH THE SAME
INTENT OR INDEED BOTH ACTS WERE DONE BY THE SAME PERSON TO SHOW
IDENTITY, THEN THE ACT MAY BE RELEVANT FOR A PURPOSE OTHER THAN
PROPENSITY. AND THAT OF COURSE IS THE EXCEPTION LAID OUT IN SECTION
1101(B). NOW, THE PROSECUTION -- AND I THINK THIS IS A THRESHOLD ISSUE
THAT YOUR HONOR MAY NEED TO CUT THROUGH IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THE
ISSUES RAISED BY THIS MOTION -- IS SEEKING TO ADD A FIFTH EXCEPTION TO
THE FOUR THAT WE FIND IN THE EVIDENCE CODE IN SECTION 1102, 1103, 780
AND 1101(B). AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS FIFTH
EXCEPTION IS NOT FOUND IN THE EVIDENCE CODE. NOWHERE IN THE EVIDENCE
CODE IS THERE ANY REFERENCES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES OR RELATIONSHIP
VIOLENCE CASES OR ANY SUGGESTION THAT A SPECIAL RULE OR A SEPARATE MODE
OF ANALYSIS APPLIES TO ANY SUCH CASE. AND THEY BASE THIS ASSERTION ON
DICTA IN A SINGLE COURT OF APPEAL OPINION, PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK, WHICH IS
THE ONLY AUTHORITY THEY CAN FIND TO JUSTIFY THIS ASSERTION THAT SOMEHOW,
RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES ARE TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER
CASES AND THAT ALL PRIOR INCIDENTS BECOME ADMISSIBLE IN A RELATIONSHIP
VIOLENCE CASE. PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK REALLY DOES NOT STAND FOR THAT
EXCEPTION. OUR CONTENTION IS THAT IT'S NOT CREATING A NEW EXCEPTION AT
ALL, BUT SIMPLY APPLYING AN OLD ONE. AND THE OLD EXCEPTION THAT IT'S
APPLYING IS THAT WHEN A DEFENDANT TESTIFIES AND PUTS HIS CHARACTER IN
ISSUE THROUGH HIS OWN TESTIMONY, RATHER THAN PRESENT A FALSE AURA OF THE
RELATIONSHIP THROUGH HIS TESTIMONY, THE PEOPLE CAN REBUT THAT TESTIMONY
AND SHOW THE PRIOR ACTS THAT COUNTER THE DEFENDANT'S ATTEMPT TO
CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP IN A PARTICULAR WAY. THE KEY FACTOR I
THINK IN PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK IS THAT THE DEFENDANT TESTIFIED IN ZACK AND
THAT THIS EVIDENCE WAS THEN OFFERED TO REBUT HIS TESTIMONY AFTER THAT
TESTIMONY WAS PRESENTED. I THINK ZACK ALSO PRESENTS AN EXAMPLE OF THE
TRADITIONAL EXCEPTIONS LAID OUT IN SECTION 1101(B) IN TERMS OF THE
REMARKABLE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE PRIOR ABUSIVE INCIDENTS, ALL OF WHICH
OCCURRED WITHIN THREE OR FOUR YEARS OF THE MURDER AND THE MURDER ITSELF.
THE COURT POINTED OUT:

"GIVEN THE BRUTAL AND UNIQUE NATURE OF THE MURDER, APPELLANT'S PRIOR
ASSAULTS OF NECESSITY COULD NOT SURVIVE A DISTINCTIVE MODUS OPERANDI
ANALYSIS." THE DISTINCTIVE BRUTAL AND UNIQUE NATURE OF THE MURDER IN
ZACK WAS THAT THE VICTIM WAS LITERALLY BEATEN TO DEATH. BOTH OF HER
ANKLES WERE BROKEN. SO OF COURSE, PRIOR ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR MAY HAVE HAD
SOME RELEVANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE CHARGE BROUGHT AGAINST THE DEFENDANT
IN THAT CASE. THE REAL PROBLEM FOR THE PROSECUTION IN THIS CASE IS THE
TOTAL LACK OF ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE PRIOR ALLEGED ACTS AND THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CRIME. LABELING THAT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE OR
LABELING IT AS A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASE REQUIRES A NEW DEFINITION.
IT REQUIRES US TO SAY, ANY TIME ANY VICTIM OF A MURDER HAD A PRIOR
RELATIONSHIP, THEN ALL OF THE EVIDENCE REGARDING THAT PRIOR RELATIONSHIP
CAN BE BROUGHT IN IF THE PARTY TO THAT RELATIONSHIP IS CHARGED WITH THE
MURDER. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY BROAD PROPOSITION. NONE OF THE TRADITIONAL
EARMARKS OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR A RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE HOMICIDE ARE
PRESENT HERE. HOW MANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES
INVOLVE MULTIPLE VICTIMS? HOW MANY INVOLVE THE COMMISSION OF A MURDER
WITH THE USE OF A KNIFE? HOW MANY INVOLVE A COMPLETE SILENCE PRECEDING
THE MURDER, SUGGESTING THAT THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED BY STEALTH RATHER
THAN BEING PRECEDED BY ANY SORT OF VIOLENT CONFRONTATION OR ARGUMENT? IN
FACT, IF WE HAD TO PUT A LABEL ON THIS CASE BASED ON THESE FACTORS, THE
LABEL WE WOULD PUT ON IT IS THAT IT BEARS ALL OF THE EARMARKS OF A
DRUG-RELATED HOMICIDE IN WHICH THE FREQUENCY OF MULTIPLE VICTIMS, THE
USE OF KNIVES, THE USE OF STEALTH IS MUCH MORE FREQUENT THAN IT IS IN
THE CASE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. NOW, IF WE TAKE THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS ONE
AT A TIME -- AND WE CERTAINLY WILL AND YOUR HONOR WILL OF COURSE BE
REQUIRED TO LOOK AT EACH OF THESE INSTANCES INDIVIDUALLY. BUT I THINK
GENERALLY, WE CAN SAY THAT NEARLY ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS INVOLVED LOUD
ARGUMENTS, THEY INVOLVED A CONFRONTATIONAL ESCALATION OF A SITUATION IN
WHICH THE DEFENDANT AND HIS SPOUSE, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, WERE IN CLOSE
PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER AND THE SITUATION THEN ESCALATED INTO A LOUD
ARGUMENT. THEY FREQUENTLY INVOLVED THE BREAKING OF GLASS, PICTURE
FRAMES. VERY FEW OF THESE INCIDENTS INVOLVED ANY PHYSICAL ASSAULT AT ALL
TO THE EXTENT PHYSICAL ASSAULTS ARE ALLEGED. THOSE ASSAULTS ARE ALL
SLAPS AND PUNCHES. THERE IS NEVER ANY ALLEGATION OF ANY USE OF A WEAPON
IN ANY OF THESE INCIDENTS AND MANY OF THE INSTANCES INVOLVE DRINKING ON
THE PART BOTH OF MR. SIMPSON AND OF HIS WIFE. SO A KEY QUESTION TO ASK
AS WE LOOK AT EACH OF THESE INCIDENTS IS, WHAT ARE THE SIMILARITIES,
WHAT ARE THE COMMON FEATURES BETWEEN WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THESE
INCIDENTS AND WHAT WENT ON ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE 12TH. AND AGAIN, WE
WOULD SUGGEST THAT A VERY USEFUL GUIDE, AND ESPECIALLY USEFUL BECAUSE IT
IS THE MOST RECENT WORD FROM THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ON THIS
COMPLEX ISSUE, APPEARS IN THE EWOLDT OPINION AND THE OPINION OF JUSTICE
GEORGE, BECAUSE HE ATTEMPTS TO DESCRIBE IN SOME DETAIL THE DEGREE OF
SIMILARITY REQUIRED FOR THREE OF THE THEORIES RELIED UPON HERE; THAT THE
PRIOR INCIDENTS ARE ADMISSIBLE TO SHOW INTENT ACCOMPANYING THE MURDER ON
JUNE 12TH, THAT THEY ARE PART OF SOME SORT OF COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN, AND
ULTIMATELY THAT THEY WILL PROVE THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR. NOW,
ADDRESSING EACH OF THESE FORMS OF ADMISSIBILITY EXCEPTIONS TO ALLOWING
PRIOR CONDUCT EVIDENCE, JUSTICE GEORGE INDICATES THAT A GREATER DEGREE
OF SIMILARITY IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PROVE A COMMON DESIGN OR PLAN THAN
IS REQUIRED TO PROVE INNOCENCE. BUT EVEN WITH RESPECT TO INTENT, HE
MAKES IT QUITE CLEAR THAT IN PROVING INTENT, THE ACT IS CONCEDED OR
ASSUMED THAT THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE IS RELEVANT TO SHOW THE STATE OF MIND
OF THE ACTOR ONCE WE ASSUME OR CONCEDE THAT THE ACTOR DID THE ACT; AND
THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHETHER HE DID IT WITH THE REQUISITE INTENT OR
STATE OF MIND. AND WE DRAW AN INFERENCE THAT BECAUSE THE ACTOR ALSO DID
THESE PRIOR ACTS WITH A PARTICULAR INTENT OR STATE OF MIND, WE CAN INFER
THAT HE DID THIS ACT WITH THE SAME INTENT OR STATE OF MIND. NOW, THAT OF
COURSE IS NOT THE CASE HERE. THE ISSUE IN THIS CASE IS GOING TO BE, WHO
DID THIS ACT ON JUNE 12TH. SO WE'RE NOT ASSUMING OR CONCEDING THAT MR.
SIMPSON DID THE ACT AND INQUIRING WHAT HIS STATE OF MIND WAS WHEN HE DID
THE ACT. IT'S QUITE CLEAR FROM THE PLEADINGS FILED BY THE PROSECUTION
THAT WHAT THEY WANT TO INFER IS IDENTITY. THEY'RE SAYING, "IF WE CAN
SHOW THE ACTS WERE DONE WITH THE SAME INTENT, FROM THAT, WE CAN THEN
INFER THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR." SO THEY'RE REALLY SEEKING TO
EVADE THE GREATER DEGREE OF SIMILARITY THAT IS NECESSARY TO SHOW
IDENTITY BY KIND OF BOOTSTRAPPING IT ON THE TAIL OF THIS THEORY OF
SHOWING INTENT WHEN THE INTENT THEORY OF COURSE ASSUMES OR CONCEDES THE
IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR. JUSTICE GEORGE THEN GOES ON TO POINT OUT
THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTS BEING PART OF A COMMON DESIGN OR
SCHEME, THAT THE SIMILARITY MUST BE NOT JUST A SIMILARITY IN THE
RESULTS, BUT SUCH A CONCURRENCE OF COMMON FEATURES THAT THE VARIOUS ACTS
ARE NATURALLY TO BE EXPLAINED AS CAUSED BY A GENERAL PLAN OF WHICH THEY
ARE INDIVIDUAL MANIFESTATIONS. SO AGAIN, IN APPLYING THIS EXCEPTION, WE
ARE CALLED UPON TO LOOK FOR THE SIMILARITY, LOOK FOR THE CONCURRENCE OF
COMMON FEATURES BETWEEN THESE PRIOR ACTS AND THE ACT THAT THE DEFENDANT
IS ON TRIAL FOR. AND THEN JUSTICE GEORGE CONCLUDES:

"THE GREATEST DEGREE OF SIMILARITY IS REQUIRED FOR EVIDENCE OF UNCHARGED
MISCONDUCT TO BE RELEVANT TO PROVE IDENTITY. FOR IDENTITY TO BE
ESTABLISHED, THE UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT AND THE CHARGED OFFENSE MUST SHARE
COMMON FEATURES THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY DISTINCTIVE SO AS TO SUPPORT THE
INFERENCE THAT THE SAME PERSON COMMITTED BOTH ACTS.

"THE PATTERN AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CRIMES," HE SAYS, "MUST BE SO
UNUSUAL AND DISTINCTIVE AS TO BE LIKE A SIGNATURE." AND THAT'S WHAT
WE'VE GOT TO LOOK FOR IN EACH OF THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS. WHERE ARE THESE
SIGNATURE FACTS THAT RECUR IN THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE ON JUNE 12TH,
1994? IDENTITY IS THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IN CONTENTION IN THIS TRIAL. AND
OF COURSE, THE RISK OF PREJUDICE OF THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE IS THE
GREATEST WHEN IT IS USED TO SHOW FACTS THAT ARE NOT REALLY IN ISSUE IN
THE CASE. JUSTICE SYSTEM GEORGE MAKES THAT POINT IN EWOLDT; THAT WHEN
WE'RE USING PRIOR ACTS TO PROVE FACTS THAT ARE NOT REALLY IN ISSUE IN
THE CASE, THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE THE GREATEST DANGER THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL
BE MISUSED FOR A PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS NOT ADMISSIBLE. AND THAT
PURPOSE IN THIS CASE IS SIMPLY IDENTITY, TO SHOW WHO IT IS WHO COMMITTED
THIS CRIME. NOW, AFTER FINDING ENOUGH SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE PRIOR ACTS
AND THE ACT OF JUNE 12TH TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF THE 1101(B) EXCEPTION,
THE COURT MUST THEN PROCEED TO ANALYZE EACH INCIDENT AS WELL IN TERMS OF
SECTION 352 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, LOOKING AT WHETHER THE PROOF OF THIS
INCIDENT WOULD REQUIRE UNDUE CONSUMPTION OF TIME IN TERMS OF THE
WITNESSES REQUIRED IN ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE RESOLVED
WITH RESPECT TO ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE. SECONDLY, THE SUBSTANTIAL DANGER OF
UNDUE PREJUDICE. AND IT IS HERE THAT THE QUESTION OF REMOTENESS IS OF
PARTICULAR RELEVANCE. THE RISK OF CONFUSION OF THE ISSUES OF WHETHER THE
JURY WILL REALLY BE ABLE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS THAT TELL THEM THEY CAN
ONLY USE THIS EVIDENCE FOR A LIMITED PURPOSE. AND FINALLY, THE DANGER OF
MISLEADING THE JURY. IF WE FOCUS ON THE REMOTENESS OF THESE INCIDENTS,
ON THE DEGREE OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THESE INCIDENTS AND WHAT HAPPENED ON
JUNE 12TH, ON THE PRESENCE OF PHYSICAL ABUSE IN THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS,
AND THAT I THINK EVEN IF WE CONCEDED THAT, PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK STANDS FOR
THE PROPOSITION FOR WHICH THE PROSECUTION HAS CITED IT. THE RULE STATED
IS THAT:

"PRIOR ASSAULTS UPON THE SAME VICTIM MAY BECOME ADMISSIBLE." AND WE NEED
TO ASK AS TO EACH OF THESE INCIDENTS WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY INVOLVED A
PHYSICAL ASSAULT ON THE VICTIM. I THINK APPLYING THOSE TESTS TO EACH
INCIDENT, WE WILL CONCLUDE THAT VIRTUALLY NONE OF THE EVIDENCE SOUGHT TO
BE ADMITTED CAN BE ADMITTED IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY
IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH. NOW, I WOULD
LIKE TO MOVE ON TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE USE OF EXPERT
WITNESSES WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR SYNDROMES BECAUSE THE PROSECUTION
HAS ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT OF CALLING TO THE WITNESS STAND IN THIS CASE AN
EXPERT WITNESS ON THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME TO EXPLAIN THAT SYNDROME
TO THE JURY. AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT THAT SYNDROME
BACK IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT IT WAS DEVELOPED TO EXPLAIN. THE BATTERED
WOMAN'S SYNDROME WAS DEVELOPED TO EXPLAIN THE IMPACT ON THE VICTIM OF
BATTERING, TO EXPLAIN WHY SUCH A VICTIM WOULD REMAIN IN A BATTERING
RELATIONSHIP, TO EXPLAIN THE STATE OF MIND OF THAT VICTIM WITH RESPECT
TO ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION THE VICTIM MAY HAVE TAKEN AGAINST THE BATTERER.
ITS PURPOSE WAS NOT TO PREDICT THE CONDUCT OF THE PERPETRATORS OF
BATTERING BEHAVIOR. AND WHAT THE PROSECUTION IS PROPOSING HERE IS NOT A
TRADITIONAL USE OF THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME, WHICH HAS BEEN
APPROVED BY THE COURTS AND AUTHORIZED BY THE EVIDENCE CODE IN SECTION
1107. BUT WHAT THEY ARE PROPOSING IS THE ONE USE OF THIS EVIDENCE THAT
IS SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED BY SECTION 1107 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE, WHICH
PROVIDES THAT:

"EXPERT EVIDENCE OFFERED BY EITHER THE PROSECUTION OR THE DEFENSE
REGARDING BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME, INCLUDING THE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL
OR MENTAL EFFECTS UPON THE BELIEVED PERCEPTIONS OR BEHAVIOR OF VICTIMS
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS ADMISSIBLE EXCEPT WHEN OFFERED AGAINST A
CRIMINAL DEFENDANT TO PROVE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE ACT OR ACTS OF ABUSE
WHICH FORM THE BASIS OF THE CRIMINAL CHARGE." AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT
THEY PROPOSE TO DO WITH THE BATTERED WOMAN'S EXPERT; TO CALL THAT EXPERT
TO PROVE THE OCCURRENCE OF A MURDER BY O.J. SIMPSON, TO SHOW THAT THE
MURDER WITH WHICH HE IS CHARGED ON JUNE 12TH IS PART OF A PATTERN OF
BEHAVIOR THAT THEY PLAN TO EXPOUND THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OF THIS
EXPERT. AND THAT OF COURSE IS THE ONE USE THAT IS PROHIBITED BY SECTION
1107. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT SECTION 1107 INTO ITS
CONTEXT OF WHY IT WAS ENACTED AND WHAT ITS PURPOSE ACTUALLY WAS. THE
ENACTMENT OF 1107 WAS SIMPLY A CODIFICATION OF AN OPINION OF THE COURT
OF APPEALS IN PEOPLE VERSUS ARIS, 215 CAL. APP. 3D, A 1989 DECISION IN
WHICH THE VICTIM OF A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP WAS ACCUSED OF MURDERING
HER HUSBAND WHILE HE SLEPT, SHOOTING HIM IN THE BACK WHILE HE SLEPT IN
HIS BED. AND AT THAT TRIAL, THE PROSECUTION PRESENTED THE TESTIMONY OF
DR. LENORE WALKER, A LEADING EXPERT WHO ACTUALLY DEVELOPED THE BATTERED
WOMAN'S SYNDROME. AND WHAT THEY PROPOSE TO DO WITH DR. WALKER'S
TESTIMONY IS TO SHOW, TO BOLSTER A CLAIM OF SELF-DEFENSE, WHY THE VICTIM
OF A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP WOULD HAVE REASONABLE FEAR OF THE PERSON WHO
BATTERED HERE EVEN WHILE HE SLEPT AND WHY IT MIGHT BE REASONABLE FOR
SUCH A PERSON TO SHOOT THAT BATTERER RATHER THAN JUST TO WALK AWAY FROM
THE RELATIONSHIP. AND WHAT THE COURT HELD IN ARIS WAS THAT DR. WALKER
WAS PROPERLY PROHIBITED FROM STATING AN OPINION THAT THE DEFENDANT
ACTUALLY PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS IN EMINENT DANGER AND NEEDED TO KILL IN
SELF-DEFENSE. BUT THE ARIS COURT SAID IT WAS NOT ERROR TO PERMIT DR.
WALKER TO TESTIFY BASED ON HER EXPERIENCE AND THE BATTERED WOMAN'S
SYNDROME THEORY AS TO HOW THE DEFENDANT'S PARTICULAR EXPERIENCES AS A
BATTERED WOMAN AFFECTED HER PERCEPTIONS OF DANGER, ITS IMMINENCE AND
WHAT ACTIONS WERE NECESSARY TO PROTECT HERSELF. NOW, WHAT THE
LEGISLATURE DID IN ENACTING 1107 IS TO CODIFY THE RULING IN PEOPLE
VERSUS ARIS THAT THE EXPERT SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO OFFER TESTIMONY WITH
RESPECT TO THE IMPACT OF BATTERING UPON THAT VICTIM'S PERCEPTION OF
IMMINENCE OF DANGER AND WHAT DANGERS OR WHAT ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO
PROTECT HERSELF. IT ALSO ABROGATED THE HOLDING OF ARIS BY SAYING THAT --

*THE COURT:* MR. UELMEN, ONE SECOND.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU. MR. UELMEN.

*MR. UELMEN:* IT ABROGATED ARIS BY SAYING THAT THE TESTIMONY OF AN
OPINION AS TO WHETHER THE DEFENDANT ACTUALLY PERCEIVED SHE WAS IN
EMINENT DANGER COULD BE ADMITTED. SO TO THAT EXTENT, THE LEGISLATURE
WENT BEYOND ARIS. BUT IN ONE RESPECT, THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY CAREFUL
TO RETAIN THE LIMITATIONS RECOGNIZED BY THE ARIS OPINION ITSELF WITH
RESPECT TO THE USE OF SUCH EVIDENCE AGAINST A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT WHO WAS
ACCUSED OF BEING THE BATTERER AND OFFERING IT TO SHOW THAT IT'S MORE
LIKELY HE COMMITTED THE CRIME AGAINST THE VICTIM OF THE BATTERING
RELATIONSHIP. IN ARIS, THE COURT SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO PRIOR OPINIONS
BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN BLEDSOE AND BY THE CALIFORNIA COURT
OF APPEAL IN BALKER. AND I THINK THAT'S A PARTICULARLY PROPORTION OF
BOTH THE ARIS OPINION AND THE SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION BECAUSE THE
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY MAKES IT QUITE CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS AWARE
OF BLEDSOE AND BALKER AND INTENDED TO CONTINUE THE PROHIBITIONS
CONTAINED IN THOSE CASES OF THE USE OF EXPERT TESTIMONY IN THE FORM THAT
THE PROSECUTION PROPOSES TO PRESENT IT IN THIS CASE. IN ARIS, THE COURT
SAID:

"THE RESPONDENT CONTENDS THAT DR. WALKER'S PROFFERED OPINION TESTIMONY
THAT DEFENDANT WAS SUFFERING FROM BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME SHOULD BE
ANALOGIZED TO THE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME AND THE RAPE
TRAUMA SYNDROME THAT WAS EXCLUDED UNDER AUTHORITY OF PEOPLE VERSUS
BLEDSOE AND PEOPLE VERSUS BALKER." AND THE COURT IN ARIS RECOGNIZED THAT
BOTH BLEDSOE AND BALKER DEALT WITH OPINIONS THAT A RAPE OR A CHILD ABUSE
VICTIM'S BEHAVIOR WERE EVIDENCE THAT THE VICTIM HAD ACTUALLY BEEN RAPED
OR ABUSED, AND THE COURTS IN THOSE CASES HELD THAT THESE OPINIONS WERE
INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT SATISFY THE KELLY-FRYE TEST AND THEY
COULDN'T SATISFY THE KELLY-FRYE TEST BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH CHILD ABUSE
ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME AND RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED
IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF
PROVING THAT A CRIME OCCURRED. THAT'S NOT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE
SYNDROMES WERE DEVELOPED AND IT'S NOT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY CAN BE
OFFERED IN EVIDENCE AT A TRIAL. AND IF YOUR HONOR GOES BACK TO THE
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT OPINION IN BLEDSOE, THEY COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT
MORE CLEARLY. READING FROM THE OPINION IN THE BLEDSOE CASE:

"GIVEN THE HISTORY, THE PURPOSE AND NATURE OF THE RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME,
WE CONCLUDE THAT EXPERT TESTIMONY THAT A COMPLAINING WITNESS SUFFERS
FROM RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME IS NOT ADMISSIBLE TO PROVE THAT THE WITNESS
WAS RAPED.

"WE EMPHASIZE OUR CONCLUSION IN THIS REGARD IS NOT INTENDED TO SUGGEST
THAT RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME IS NOT GENERALLY RECOGNIZED OR USED IN THE
GENERAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, BUT ONLY THAT IT IS NOT RELIED ON IN THAT
COMMUNITY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE PROSECUTION SOUGHT TO USE IT IN
THIS CASE; NAMELY, TO PROVE THAT A RAPE IN FACT OCCURRED.

"BECAUSE THE LITERATURE DOES NOT EVEN PURPORT TO CLAIM THAT THE SYNDROME
IS A SCIENTIFICALLY RELIABLE MEANS OF PROVING THAT A RAPE OCCURRED, WE
CONCLUDE THAT IT MAY NOT PROPERLY BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE IN A CRIMINAL
TRIAL." AND WE HAVE A PRECISELY ANALOGOUS SITUATION HERE. THE BATTERED
WOMAN'S SYNDROME WAS NOT DEVELOPED TO PREDICT WHICH VICTIMS OF BATTERING
ARE LIKELY TO SUBSEQUENTLY BECOME THE VICTIMS OF A HOMICIDE. THE
STATISTICAL BASIS OF THE PREDICTION SIMPLY WOULDN'T SUPPORT THAT USE OF
THE SYNDROME. EVEN USING THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY
BATTERINGS OF WOMEN THERE ARE EVERY YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT
NUMBER IS AROUND TWO MILLION. APPLYING THE MOST EXPANSIVE ESTIMATES OF
HOW MANY HOMICIDES -- OF THE 22,000 HOMICIDES IN AMERICA EVERY YEAR, HOW
MANY OF THOSE HOMICIDES ARE SPOUSAL ABUSE TYPE HOMICIDES, THE NUMBER
RANGES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 2,000 AND 4,000. SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LESS
THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE ACTUAL BATTERING INCIDENTS RESULTING IN A
HOMICIDE IN A GIVEN YEAR. NOW, WHAT THE PROSECUTION PROPOSES TO DO IN
THIS CASE IS TO WORK BACKWARDS. ASSUME THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR.
ASSUME THAT MR. SIMPSON WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS MURDER. THEREFORE,
NOW WE CAN LOOK BACKWARD AT THE PRIOR RELATIONSHIP, AND THAT BECOMES
RELEVANT TO EXPLAIN HIS BEHAVIOR WITH RESPECT TO THIS INCIDENT. BUT OF
COURSE, HERE THE IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR IS WHAT IS AT ISSUE IN THIS
CASE. AND WHAT THE PROSECUTION REALLY WANTS TO DO IS TO SAY BASED ON AN
EXPERT'S ANALYSIS OF THIS PRIOR RELATIONSHIP FOR A 17-YEAR PERIOD, WE
CAN PREDICT THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT MR. SIMPSON WAS THE PERPETRATOR
OF THIS MURDER ON JUNE 12TH. THE SCIENCE DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT, THE
BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME WAS NOT DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT THAT AND THAT IS
THE PRECISE USE OF THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME THAT IS PROHIBITED BY
SECTION 1107 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE. SO WE WILL CONTEND OF COURSE THAT NOT
ONLY ARE THESE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS IRRELEVANT WITH RESPECT TO PROVING
THE OFFENSE CHARGED ON JUNE 12TH, BUT THE ADMISSION OF ANY EXPERT
TESTIMONY TO ATTEMPT TO INTERPRET THESE INCIDENTS AND PRESENT SOME
OPINION TO THE JURY BASED UPON THEM WOULD BE HIGHLY IMPROPER AND IN
DIRECT CONTRAVENTION OF SECTION 1107 AS WELL AS OF THE CALIFORNIA
SUPREME COURT RULING IN BLEDSOE AND THE COURT OF APPEAL OPINION IN
BALKER DEALING WITH THE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME. THE
FINAL GENERAL ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO ADDRESS BEFORE MOVING INTO THE
INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS RELATES TO THE PROHIBITION OF HEARSAY TESTIMONY.
AND OF COURSE, THE HEARSAY RULE IS ALSO DESIGNED TO PROTECT A
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF ANY CRIMINAL ACCUSED; AND THAT IS THE RIGHT TO
CONFRONT AND TO CROSS-EXAMINE THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM. NOW, YOUR HONOR
IS WELL AWARE OF COURSE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF EXCEPTIONS TO THE
HEARSAY RULE, EXCEPTIONS BASED UPON CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHOW THAT THE
OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENT IS SO RELIABLE THAT WE DON'T NEED TO
CROSS-EXAMINE THE DECLARANT IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF OR THE
ACCURACY OF THAT STATEMENT. NOW, WITH RESPECT TO MOST OF THE ITEMS, AS
YOU GO THROUGH THE LIST OF ALL OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE IN ISSUE, NO
EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE HAS EVEN BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WOULD MAKE
ANY OF THESE STATEMENTS, OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS ADMISSIBLE AS AN
EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE. I REFER SPECIFICALLY TO ALL OF THE
INCIDENTS THAT WERE DERIVED FROM A DOCUMENT THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS
CALLED A DIARY, WHICH IS FAR FROM A DIARY. WHAT IT IS IS A MEMO PREPARED
FOR THE DIVORCE LAWYER REPRESENTING MRS. SIMPSON IN THE DIVORCE
PROCEEDINGS LEADING TO THE DISSOLUTION OF HER MARRIAGE WITH MR. SIMPSON.
AND WHAT MRS. SIMPSON WAS ASKED TO DO, AS MANY PARTIES ARE TO THESE
TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS, IS TO SIT DOWN AND JUST MAKE UP A LIST OF
EVERYTHING THAT SHE COULD RECALL THAT SHE THOUGHT MIGHT BE USABLE TO
OBTAIN SOME ADVANTAGE IN THAT DIVORCE PROCEEDING. THESE KINDS OF
DOCUMENTS ARE NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE. THEY ARE PREPARED WITH A MOTIVE TO
EXAGGERATE. THEY ARE PREPARED IN ORDER TO GAIN SOME ADVANTAGE IN PENDING
LITIGATION. THEY ARE NOT PROOF OF ANY STATE OF MIND OTHER THAN THE STATE
OF MIND THAT ACCOMPANIES THE LITIGATION FOR WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED. SO
THERE'S SIMPLY NO EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE THAT WOULD PERMIT A
DOCUMENT OF THIS NATURE TO BE BROUGHT INTO COURT TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF
THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THAT DOCUMENT WITHOUT CROSS-EXAMINATION OF
THE DECLARANT. SO UNTIL THE PEOPLE CAN AT LEAST PRESENT SOME PLAUSIBLE
THEORY OF AN EXCEPTION THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE USE OF THIS EVIDENCE, I
THINK YOUR HONOR CAN MAKE SHORT SHRIFT OF ANY INCIDENTS OR ISSUES WHERE
THE ONLY PROOF OF THEM IS GOING TO COME IN THE NATURE OF THAT KIND OF
DOCUMENT WHICH WILL BE READILY EXCLUDABLE AS HEARSAY. THE TWO EXCEPTIONS
THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS PRESENTED WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE EVIDENCE
THEY PROPOSE TO PRESENT IS THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS A SPONTANEOUS STATEMENT
MADE UNDER THE EXCITEMENT OF PERCEIVED CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT THE
OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS WILL BE ADMISSIBLE TO SHOW THE STATE OF MIND OF
THE DECLARANT. NOW, ONCE AGAIN, I THINK IF YOUR HONOR ADDRESSES THE
QUESTION OF WHAT IS REALLY AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE, WE CAN CUT THROUGH A
LOT OF THIS EVIDENCE AND SIMPLY RESOLVE IT BY RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS
NO ISSUE IN THIS CASE AS TO THE STATE OF MIND OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON OR
THE STATE OF MIND OF RONALD GOLDMAN FOR THAT MATTER. THERE ARE NO
FACTUAL ISSUES RELATED TO ANY OF THEIR CONDUCT ON THE -- AT THE TIME
THAT THE KILLING OCCURRED. THERE IS NO NEED TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING THEY DID
OR DIDN'T DO AT THE TIME THEY BECAME VICTIMS OF THIS HOMICIDE. IT'S
SIMPLY NOT AN ISSUE IN THE CASE. AND HERE, THERE ARE TWO VERY RECENT
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT OPINIONS DIRECTLY ON POINT ON WHICH THE DEFENSE
WILL RELY. BOTH INVOLVE VICTIMS WHO EXPRESSED FEARS OF THE DEFENDANT
ACCUSED OF THEIR MURDER TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. AND IN BOTH OF
THESE CASES, THE COURT HELD THERE WAS NO HEARSAY EXCEPTION THAT
JUSTIFIED THE ADMISSION OF THIS EVIDENCE AND ITS ADMISSION WAS
REVERSIBLE ERROR. THE FIRST OF THESE CASES IS PEOPLE VERSUS IRELAND, 70
CAL. 2D 529, IN WHICH THE -- AND THIS IS A CASE OF A SPOUSAL MURDER, A
HUSBAND ACCUSED OF MURDERING HIS WIFE. THE PROSECUTION CALLED AS A
WITNESS A FAMILY FRIEND WHO HAD KNOWN THE DEFENDANT FOR 11 YEARS WHO
TESTIFIED THAT THE WITNESS HAD VISITED HER, AND THE PROSECUTION ASKED
HER THE SUBSTANCE OF A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION SHE HAD WITH THE VICTIM IN
WHICH THE VICTIM ALLEGEDLY SAID -- AND THIS WAS ON THE VERY MORNING THAT
THE MURDER OCCURRED.

"I KNOW HE'S GOING TO KILL ME. I WISH HE WOULD HURRY UP AND GET IT OVER
WITH. HE'LL NEVER LET ME LEAVE." THE VERY MORNING THAT THE VICTIM WAS
MURDERED, THOSE FEARS WERE EXPRESSED TO A CLOSE FAMILY FRIEND. AND THE
PROSECUTION'S THEORY WAS THE SAME THEORY OFFERED HERE; THAT IT WAS
RELEVANT TO SHOW THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIM. AND THE COURT SAID,
SUCH STATE OF MIND SIMPLY WASN'T RELEVANT, IT WAS NOT AN ISSUE IN THE
CASE IN TERMS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MURDER THAT OCCURRED. IT IS
CLEAR AT THE OUTSET THE COURT SAID THAT THE DECLARANT'S, ANN'S, STATE OF
MIND ON THE DAY OF THE DEATH WAS NOT ITSELF AN ISSUE IN THE CASE. THE
DEFENSE DID NOT RAISE ANY ISSUE OF FACT WITH RESPECT TO ANN'S CONDUCT
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING HER DEATH. THEREFORE, THE EVIDENCE WAS
INADMISSIBLE. THE IRELAND CASE WAS FOLLOWED IN THE SUBSEQUENT DECISION
OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN PEOPLE VERSUS ARCEGA, A 1982 OPINION,
IN WHICH THE PROSECUTION ASKED THE VICTIM'S MOTHER WHETHER THE VICTIM
HAD EVER EXPRESSED FEAR OF THE DEFENDANT. THE OBJECTION WAS MADE THAT
THIS WAS HEARSAY. THE OBJECTION WAS OVERRULED, AND THE MOTHER THEN
TESTIFIED THAT SHORTLY BEFORE HER DEATH, THE APPELLATE TOLD HER THAT THE
DEFENDANT -- OR THE VICTIM TOLD HER THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS TREATING HER
WEIRD BY FOLLOWING HER CLOSELY AROUND THE APARTMENT. THE VICTIM
EXPRESSED TO HER MOTHER THE FEAR THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS GOING TO HIT
HER, TO BEAT HER UP. AND AGAIN, THE THEORY OFFERED FOR THAT WAS THE SAME
THEORY OFFERED HERE; THAT THIS EVIDENCE WAS TO SHOW THE STATE OF MIND OF
THE VICTIM. AND THE COURT, CITING PEOPLE VERSUS IRELAND, CONCLUDED THAT
THE VICTIM'S STATE OF MIND WAS NOT AN ISSUE IN THE CASE. THEREFORE, IT
WAS ERROR AND IT WAS REVERSIBLE ERROR TO ADMIT THAT EVIDENCE. THE COURT
CONCLUDED IN THE PRESENT CASE, AS IN IRELAND:

"THE ACTS OR CONDUCT OF THE DECLARANT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE HOMICIDE
WERE SIMPLY NOT IN DISPUTE.

"THE DEFENSE DID NOT QUESTION PROSECUTION EVIDENCE WHICH INDICATED THAT
THE VICTIM WAS LYING ON HER BED AT THE TIME OF THE KILLING. THEREFORE,
ADMISSION OF THE HEARSAY STATEMENTS REGARDING MILNER'S FEAR OF THE
APPELLATE AND HIS WEIRD ACTIONS WAS ERROR." AND THAT IS PRECISELY THE
SITUATION THAT WILL BE PRESENTED IN THIS CASE. THE DEFENSE WILL NOT
OFFER ANY EVIDENCE OR MAKE ANY ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE OF MIND
OF EITHER OF THESE VICTIMS AT THE TIME THEY WERE KILLED. SO THIS
EVIDENCE SIMPLY WILL NOT BE RELEVANT TO ANY ISSUE IN THIS CASE. THAT --
IF I COULD JUST HAVE A MOMENT.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MR. UELMEN:* THAT CONCLUDES THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE WANTED TO
CALL TO YOUR HONOR'S ATTENTION WITH RESPECT TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF ALL
OF THIS EVIDENCE. I BELIEVE THESE GENERAL PRINCIPLES CAN GREATLY
SIMPLIFY THE DIFFICULT TASK THAT AWAITS YOUR HONOR BY SIMPLY CONCLUDING
THAT AN EXPERT WITNESS ON THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME WILL NOT BE
ADMISSIBLE FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE PROSECUTION PROPOSES TO OFFER
IT, BY SIMPLY RULING THAT THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASE
IS IRRELEVANT, BY SETTING SOME SORT OF TEMPORAL GUIDELINES WITH RESPECT
TO REMOTENESS OF HOW FAR ARE WE GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO GO BACK IN THIS
INQUIRING INTO THESE PRIOR INCIDENTS AND BY INSISTING THAT EVERY PRIOR
INCIDENT HAVE SOME SIMILARITY TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIME THAT IS
CHARGED IN THIS CASE, THAT THERE IS NO GENERAL EXCEPTION OR SPECIAL
EXCEPTION FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES. I THINK WE CAN CUT THROUGH A LOT
OF THIS EVIDENCE IN VERY SHORT ORDER AND CONCLUDE THAT IT IS
INADMISSIBLE. IF YOUR HONOR PREFERS, WE CAN HAVE THE PEOPLE RESPOND TO
THESE GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND THEN ADDRESS EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL
INCIDENTS INDIVIDUALLY.

*MS. BODIN:* MAY WE HAVE A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. GORDON:* YOUR HONOR, WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE DEFENSE FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY. HOWEVER, WE THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BEST FOR THE COURT
AND FOR THE CLEAREST PRESENTATION OF OUR EVIDENCE FOR THIS MOTION TO LET
THE DEFENSE FINISH, AND THEN WE CAN RESPOND BOTH IN GENERAL THEORIES AND
SPECIFICALLY, IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH THE COURT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. GORDON:* IF NOT, WE CAN PRESENT SOME GENERAL RESPONSE NOW.

*THE COURT:* WELL, I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE GENERAL ISSUES THAT ARE
INVOLVED. BUT AT SOME POINT, I NEED TO KNOW WHAT SPECIFIC INCIDENTS THAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO WE CAN PUT THIS ALL IN CONTEXT. THE MOVING PAPERS
FILED BY THE DEFENSE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIMITED IN SCOPE REGARDING
THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OR ALLEGED INCIDENTS THAN
THE PEOPLE'S. SO I'M JUST CONCERNED IN DEFINING THE SCOPE OF WHAT IT IS
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND AND FULLY APPRECIATE THE
ARGUMENTS BEING MADE BY COUNSEL.

*MR. GORDON:* CERTAINLY WE PLAN TO IN OUR PRESENTATION NOT ONLY PROVIDE
THE COURT WITH LEGAL ANALYSIS, BUT TO GO THROUGH AND SPECIFICALLY
ANALYZE EVENTS FACTUALLY AND LEGALLY WITHIN OUR PRESENTATION WITHIN THAT
REGARD. THAT'S WHY WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP OUR PRESENTATION SOMEWHAT UNIFIED.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. GORDON:* IT JUST MIGHT BE CLEANER, IF THAT'S OKAY WITH THE COURT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. UELMEN.

*MR. UELMEN:* I THINK YOUR HONOR'S CHART PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT REFERENCE
POINT TO WORK THROUGH THIS. OF COURSE, OUR MOTION WAS PREPARED BACK IN
NOVEMBER BASED ON THE DISCOVERY THAT HAD BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THE
DEFENSE UP TO THAT POINT. AND SINCE THAT TIME, AS YOUR HONOR IS AWARE, A
NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL ITEMS, STATEMENTS AND DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED
TO THE DEFENSE AND REFERRED TO IN THE RESPONSE TO OUR MOTION BY THE
PROSECUTION; AND IT'S VERY HELPFUL THAT YOUR HONOR'S LITTLE CHART
INDICATES WHERE IN THE PLEADINGS EACH OF THESE ALLEGED INCIDENTS IS
REFERRED TO AND IT'S IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. SO I THINK WE CAN SIMPLY
STICK TO THAT REGIMEN. IT WILL MAKE YOUR HONOR'S TASK A LOT EASIER IF WE
JUST GO THROUGH EACH OF THESE ALLEGED INCIDENTS AS THEY ARE LAID OUT IN
THAT CHRONOLOGY.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THEN BEFORE YOU LAUNCH INTO THAT, TO GIVE CREDIT
WHERE CREDIT IS DUE, THIS WAS PREPARED BY PEPPERDINE STUDENT LAW CLERK
STEVE TYLER.

*MR. UELMEN:* THE CHRONOLOGY BEGINS WITH 1977. AND OF COURSE, I THINK
THAT RIGHT AT THE OUTSET RAISES THE WHOLE ISSUE OF REMOTENESS, OF HOW
FAR ARE WE GOING TO GO BACK IN TERMS OF THE ALLOWANCE OF EVIDENCE OF
THIS NATURE IN TERMS OF THE POLICIES THAT WE OUTLINED OF PUTTING MR.
SIMPSON IN THE DEFENSE OF HAVING TO DEFEND AGAINST UNCHARGED CONDUCT, OF
THE RISK OF PREJUDICE OF THIS MATERIAL IN TERMS OF ITS VERY LIMITED
RELEVANCE BEING GIVEN MORE WEIGHT THAN IT TRULY DESERVES. BUT I THINK
ITEMS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 AND 6 ALL COME DIRECTLY FROM THIS DOCUMENT THAT I
JUST REFERRED TO THAT THE PEOPLE ARE CALLING A DIARY, WHICH REALLY ISN'T
A DIARY, THIS MEMO THAT WAS PREPARED IN ORDER FOR -- TO ASSIST THE
LAWYER REPRESENTING MRS. SIMPSON IN THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS. SO THERE IS
NO SOURCE PER PEOPLE'S WITNESSES FOR ANY OF THESE SIX ALLEGED INCIDENTS.
THEY ARE ALL ALLEGATIONS THAT COME DIRECTLY FROM THE MEMORANDUM PREPARED
BY THE VICTIM, WHO IS OF COURSE UNAVAILABLE FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION. SO I
BELIEVE THE HEARSAY OBJECTION SHOULD DISPOSE OF ALL SIX OF THESE ITEMS.
AND WE'RE STILL WAITING TO HEAR ANY PLAUSIBLE THEORY OF ANY EXCEPTION TO
THE HEARSAY RULE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE ADMISSION OF ANY OF THIS
EVIDENCE. ITEM 7, THIS COMES FROM THE PROSECUTION RESPONSE SIMPLY
SUMMARIZING EVIDENCE THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN PRESENT THROUGH DENISE
BROWN AND ED MC CABE THAT SOMETIME IN 1982 -- AND AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW
WHEN THIS OCCURRED -- THE DEFENDANT GRABBED THE VICTIM'S CLOTHES, BROKE
SOME PICTURES AND THREW THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE. AGAIN, OF COURSE, THE
DIFFICULTY OF DEFENDING AGAINST THIS ALLEGATION IS COMPOUNDED BY THE
LACK OF ANY DATE OR EVEN APPROXIMATE DATE WHEN THIS OCCURRED. AND AS
WITH ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS, I THINK WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES HOW
SIMILAR IS THIS TO WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH, 1994. I MEAN HOW DOES --
I MEAN EVEN IF WE ASSUME THIS TOOK PLACE AS DESCRIBED IN THE PEOPLE'S
MOVING PAPERS, THAT IN THE COURSE OF AN ARGUMENT IN 1982, 12 YEARS
BEFORE THIS MURDER TOOK PLACE, THAT THEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT AND HE
THREW HER OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH HER CLOTHES, WHAT DOES THAT SHOW IN
TERMS OF THE MOTIVE, INTENT OR IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS
MURDER IN 1994? WE WOULD CONCLUDE THAT SECTION 1101(B) IS NOT SERVED BY
THIS EVIDENCE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR PREJUDICE FAR OUTWEIGHS ANY
PROBATIVE VALUE THAT IT WOULD HAVE. ITEM NUMBER 8 PRESENTS A VERY
AMBIGUOUS STATEMENT BY -- ATTRIBUTED TO A FORMER MAID WHO WAS EMPLOYED
AT THE SIMPSON RESIDENCE WHO SIMPLY DESCRIBED AT SOME POINT IN 1984 OR
1985 -- AGAIN, WE HAVE NO PRECISE DATE IN TERMS OF DEFENDING AGAINST
THIS CHARGE -- SHE SAW MRS. SIMPSON OUTSIDE THE HOUSE. THERE WAS NO
STATEMENT MADE AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED. SHE WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SAW
A BUNCH OF BROKEN PICTURES ON THE FLOOR. WHAT INFERENCE WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO DERIVE FROM THAT AND HOW THAT IS EVEN RELEVANT TO WHAT HAPPENED ON
JUNE 12TH, 1994 IS LEFT TO OUR IMAGINATION. I MEAN EVEN IF WE INFER THAT
IN A MOMENT OF ANGER 10 YEARS BEFORE, MR. SIMPSON BROKE SOME PICTURE
FRAMES, WHAT DOES THAT TELL US IN TERMS OF ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN
1994? NUMBER 9 AND NUMBER 14 ARE CLOSELY RELATED IN THE SENSE THAT THE
PERCIPIENT WITNESS WITH RESPECT TO THIS INCIDENT IS LOS ANGELES POLICE
DEPARTMENT DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN. THERE IS NO CONTEMPORANEOUS POLICE
REPORT WITH RESPECT TO THIS INCIDENT. IN FACT, WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY
CONTEMPORANEOUS ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS ALLEGED INCIDENT AT
ALL. WHAT WE HAVE IS A 1989 LETTER IN WHICH DETECTIVE FUHRMAN CLAIMS TO
HAVE A VERY DETAILED MEMORY OF WHAT WAS SAID AND WHAT TOOK PLACE. AND
THAT LETTER SUGGESTS THAT WHAT HE ENCOUNTERED WAS AN ARGUMENT RELATED TO
DAMAGE DONE TO MRS. SIMPSON'S AUTOMOBILE BY MR. SIMPSON. AGAIN, WE DON'T
KNOW WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE. IT MAY HAVE BEEN EVEN BEFORE MR. AND MRS.
SIMPSON WERE ACTUALLY MARRIED. THE ALLEGATION IS THAT MR. SIMPSON TOOK A
BASEBALL BAT AND DAMAGED MRS. SIMPSON'S AUTOMOBILE. AND THE CONCERN SHE
EXPRESSED WAS, WHO WAS GOING TO PAY FOR FIXING UP HER CAR. THERE WAS NO
PHYSICAL ASSAULT. THERE'S NOT ANY ALLEGATION OF ANY PHYSICAL ASSAULT. IT
IS SIMPLY AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO REPAIR A CAR. ONCE AGAIN,
WHAT DOES THIS TELL US OR HOW DOES THIS ASSIST THE JURY IN DETERMINING
WHAT TOOK PLACE ON JUNE 12TH, 1994? WHERE IS ANY SIMILARITY TO ANY OF
THE EVIDENCE SURROUNDING THE EVENTS OF JUNE 12TH, 1994? AND OF COURSE,
THE DANGER OR THE RISK OF PREJUDICE OF THIS BEING USED SIMPLY TO COME TO
THE CONCLUSION THAT MR. SIMPSON HAS A BAD TEMPER OR MR. SIMPSON IS A BAD
MAN; THEREFORE, IT'S MORE LIKELY HE COMMITTED THIS CRIME IS A VERY GRAVE
ONE IN THE CONTEXT OF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY AN INCIDENT AS
MUCH AS 10 YEARS OLD. ITEM NUMBER 10 ON YOUR HONOR'S LIST REFERS TO --
EXCUSE ME.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND
DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. UELMEN:* ITEM NUMBER 10 REFERS TO AN INCIDENT ALLEGEDLY TAKING
PLACE IN SEPTEMBER OF 1986 IN WHICH MRS. SIMPSON WAS TREATED AT A
HOSPITAL FOR INJURIES RELATED TO A BICYCLE ACCIDENT. AND THE PEOPLE HAVE
REFERRED TO THE TESTIMONY OF A DR. MARTIN ALPERT, WHO THEY PROPOSE TO
PRESENT TO EXPRESS SOME RESERVATIONS HE HAD AS TO WHETHER IN FACT THE
INJURIES WERE OBTAINED IN THAT MANNER. THE DIFFICULTY OF COURSE WITH
THIS -- AND THIS IS GOING TO PRESENT A VERY SUBSTANTIAL 402, 403
QUESTION FOR THE COURT TO RESOLVE BEFORE THIS EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED TO A
JURY WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER ANY INFERENCE CAN BE DRAWN FROM THE OPINION
OF DR. ALPERT APPARENTLY BASED ON HIS RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAPPENED NINE
YEARS AGO. THE MEDICAL RECORDS AND X-RAYS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. THE
PHOTOGRAPHS OF COURSE OFFER NO ILLUMINATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED
PRECEDING THESE INJURIES. THERE IS NO BASIS PRESENTED WHATSOEVER TO
DOUBT THE ACCOUNT OF HOW THESE INJURIES ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE THAT WAS
PRESENTED TO THE DOCTOR AT THE TIME THE TREATMENT TOOK PLACE. SO WITH
RESPECT TO THAT INCIDENT OR ALLEGED INCIDENT, WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS.
FIRST IS A PROBLEM OF PROOF IN TERMS OF HOW ANY INFERENCE THAT THE
PEOPLE WANT TO DRAW FROM THIS EVIDENCE WILL BE JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE
THEY PROPOSE TO PRESENT; AND SECONDLY, EVEN IF THAT INFERENCE IS
JUSTIFIED, WHAT IT PROVES IN TERMS OF THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE ON JUNE
12TH, 1994. IF ALL IT PROVES IS THAT SOME EFFORT WAS MADE TO CONCEAL THE
TRUE NATURE OF INJURIES THAT WERE SUSTAINED BY MRS. SIMPSON IN 1986,
WHAT DOES THAT PROVE IN TERMS OF WHAT TOOK PLACE IN 1994? IT DOESN'T
SHOW THE IDENTITY. IT DOESN'T SHOW ANY MOTIVE. IT DOESN'T KNOW ANY
INTENT WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF
WHAT HAPPENED IN 1994. NOW, I MAY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO
RAISE ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS AFTER I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONFER
WITH COCOUNSEL. BUT I'LL KEEP GOING SO WE CAN GET THROUGH AS MUCH AS WE
CAN BEFORE THE LUNCHEON RECESS. INCIDENTS 11 AND 12 AGAIN ARE RANK
HEARSAY. THE ONLY SOURCE OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT EITHER OF THESE
ALLEGATIONS COMES FROM THAT SUPPOSED DIARY. AND AGAIN, NO PLAUSIBLE
THEORY OF ANY EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE HAS BEEN PRESENTED BY THE
PEOPLE. WITH RESPECT TO ITEM NUMBER 13, THIS OF COURSE IS THE ONE
INCIDENT THAT ACTUALLY WAS BROUGHT TO COURT AND RESULTED IN A CRIMINAL
CONVICTION OF THE DEFENDANT BASED ON HIS PLEA OF NO CONTEST TO A CHARGE
OF ASSAULTING MRS. SIMPSON. AND WITH RESPECT TO THIS INCIDENT, WE HAVE
POLICE REPORTS, WE HAVE ACCOUNTS IN THE FORM OF LETTERS OF EXPLANATION
WRITTEN BY THE DEFENDANT HIMSELF, INTERVIEWS AND A GOOD DEAL OF
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE. AND WHAT APPARENTLY TOOK
PLACE WAS THAT AT THE CONCLUSION OF A NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATION IN WHICH
BOTH MR. SIMPSON AND NICOLE SIMPSON HAD A LOT TO DRINK, THEY GOT INTO AN
ARGUMENT IN THEIR BEDROOM. AND THE CULMINATION OF THAT ARGUMENT WAS A
PHYSICAL ASSAULT IN WHICH MR. SIMPSON ADMITTED THAT HE SLAPPED AND
PUNCHED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. SHE THEN CALLED THE POLICE. THERE WAS A
POLICE INTERVENTION, AND THE CULMINATION OF THAT INTERVENTION WAS THE
FILING OF A CHARGE TO WHICH MR. SIMPSON ENTERED A NO CONTEST. HE WAS
PLACED ON PROBATION ON THE CONDITION THAT HE UNDERGO COUNSELING. HE
FULFILLED ALL OF THE CONDITIONS OF THAT PROBATION. AND HERE, ONCE AGAIN,
WE SIMPLY ASK, WHAT'S THE RELEVANCE OF THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED ON
JUNE 12TH, 1994? WHERE IS THERE ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN A BEDROOM
ARGUMENT IN WHICH BOTH PARTIES HAD BEEN DRINKING AND THE ARGUMENT
ESCALATES INTO A SLAPPING INCIDENT AND THE SLASHING OF TWO PEOPLE'S
THROATS ON A SIDEWALK ON JUNE 12TH, 1994? HOW CAN WE DRAW ANY INFERENCE
THAT BOTH OF THESE INCIDENTS WERE DONE OR BOTH OF THESE EVENTS WERE DONE
WITH THE SAME INTENT, WITH THE SAME MOTIVE OR BY THE SAME PERSON? WHERE
IS THERE ANY RELEVANCE IN TERMS OF ASSISTING THE JURY IN DETERMINING WHO
KILLED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, WHO KILLED RONALD GOLDMAN TO KNOW THAT FIVE
YEARS BEFORE, AFTER A NEW YEAR'S PARTY, MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE GOT
INTO AN ARGUMENT? IT SIMPLY DOES NOTHING IN TERMS OF THE TASK THAT FACES
THIS JURY WHILE THE RISK OF PREJUDICE IS OVERWHELMING. THE RISK THAT
THEY WILL DRAW IS SIMPLY AN INFERENCE OF BAD CHARACTER, BAD TEMPER AND
ASSUME BASED ON THAT INFERENCE THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT MR. SIMPSON IS
THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS MURDER. AND FOR THAT PURPOSE, WE WOULD CONTEND
IT SIMPLY HAS NO RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER. ITEM NUMBER 15, THE WRITING OF A
LETTER RELATING TO THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT, AGAIN, WE'RE NOT AWARE OF
WHAT RELEVANCE THAT WOULD HAVE ALTHOUGH IT WOULD COME WITHIN A HEARSAY
EXCEPTION SINCE IT WAS WRITTEN BY THE DEFENDANT. BUT WHAT DOES IT PROVE?
WHAT DOES IT PROVE IN TERMS OF WHAT TOOK PLACE IN 1994? ITEM NUMBER 16,
THE -- AGAIN, SIMPLY A STATEMENT BY THE VICTIM TO SOME THIRD PERSON
WHICH IS HEARSAY. NO HEARSAY SUGGESTION IS SUGGESTED. CERTAINLY THE
VICTIM'S STATE OF MIND IN 1989 IS NOT RELEVANT TO ANY QUESTION WITH
RESPECT TO EVENTS TAKING PLACE FIVE YEARS LATER. AND EVEN, AS WE'VE
ALREADY ARGUED, STATE OF MIND FIVE YEARS LATER IS IRRELEVANT, THAT IT'S
NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS EVIDENCE
SHOULD BE EXCLUDED SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS HEARSAY. WOULD THIS BE A
CONVENIENT POINT TO TAKE OUR RECESS?

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, WE'LL TAKE OUR NOON HOUR RECESS AT THIS
TIME. WE WILL RECONVENE PROMPTLY AT 1:30. THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

(AT 11:55 A.M., THE NOON RECESS WAS TAKEN UNTIL 1:30 P.M. OF THE SAME DAY.)

(CHRISTINE M. OLSON, CSR NO. 2378, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. SHAPIRO, ARE WE READY TO START?

*MR. SHAPIRO:* YES, WE ARE.

*THE COURT:* BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. MR. SIMPSON IS
AGAIN PRESENT WITH COUNSEL, MR. SHAPIRO, MR. COCHRAN, MR. BAILEY, MR.
UELMEN. THE PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED BY MR. GORDON, MISS BODIN AND MR.
GOLDBERG. MR. UELMEN, WE WERE AT ITEM NO. 16 ON THE CHART PREPARED BY
STEVEN GOLUB.

*MR. UELMEN:* YOUR HONOR --

*MS. BODIN:* RESPECTFULLY, MAY WE JUST BRIEFLY INTERRUPT FOR A MOMENT?
THE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION WITH REGARD TO THE ADDENDUM TO
THEIR STATEMENT. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A WITNESS BY THE NAME OF DONALD G.
DUTTON, AND HIS CURRICULUM VITAE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THE DEFENSE AND HE
IS PRESENT IN THE COURT. WE WOULD LIKE HIM TO REMAIN DURING THE COURSE
OF THIS HEARING AND I DO HAVE THE CURRICULUM VITAE RIGHT NOW. WOULD THE
COURT LIKE TO SEE IT?

*THE COURT:* DO YOU HAVE A COPY FOR COUNSEL?

*MR. GORDON:* YES, COUNSEL HAS IT. WOULD THE COURT LIKE A COPY ALSO?

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MS. BODIN:* WITH REGARD TO THE MOTION THAT THE PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE IN
TERMS OF ADDING INTO THEIR ALLEGED INCIDENTS OF ABUSE, THERE WAS
INFORMATION TODAY THAT WAS RECEIVED BY THE COURT FROM SOJOURN AND WE
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT IN OUR MOTION BEFORE THE COURT.
WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS ADDRESS IT FACTUALLY AND THEN PERHAPS SAVE
THE LEGAL ARGUMENT SOMEWHERE TOWARD THE END SO COUNSEL HAS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO PREPARE LEGALLY ON THAT ISSUE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. MR. UELMEN.

*MR. UELMEN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. IF WE GO BACK TO THE CHRONOLOGY --
AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT
59 DISCREET INCIDENTS, WE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT A CHRONOLOGY THAT TRIES
TO PUT EVERYTHING IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER, SOME OF WHICH DOESN'T REALLY
RELATE TO ANY INCIDENT AT ALL, BUT IS SIMPLY AN EVENT, SUCH AS THE FACT
THAT MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE INITIATED DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS IN JANUARY
OF '92 -- I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT, WE ASSUME,
WILL BE ADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE AND IS REALLY TOTALLY IRRELEVANT IN TERMS
OF ANY CHARACTER EVIDENCE PROVING ANYTHING WITH RESPECT TO THE EVENTS IN
ISSUE IN THIS CASE. GOING BACK TO WHERE WE LEFT OFF, WHICH WAS ITEM NO.
17, I THINK HERE WE SIMPLY HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE --
THE PROSECUTION HAS KIND OF PULLED OUT ALL THE STOPS, GONE TO THE
HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS AND ATTEMPTED TO GATHER TOGETHER ANYONE WHO COULD
EVER SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT MR. SIMPSON IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST 17
YEARS. ALFRED ACOSTA WAS SIMPLY THE DRIVER OF AN AUTOMOBILE WHO TOOK MR.
SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE HOME ONE EVENING. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT EVENING
WAS. WE ARE TOLD IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY TIME IN 1988 OR 1989, SO WE HAVE
A SPECTRUM OF 300 -- 720 DAYS THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK FROM.
APPARENTLY, ACCORDING TO MR. ACOSTA'S STATEMENT, THEY HAD BEEN DRINKING,
AND WHILE HE IS DRIVING THE CAR ALONG, ALLEGEDLY, HE BELIEVES THAT MR.
SIMPSON HIT MR. -- MRS. SIMPSON IN THE BACK OF THE LIMOUSINE. NOW, WHAT
DOES THAT DO FOR US IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN JUNE OF 1994? WHAT DOES
THAT TELL US? WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT ANY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS
THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH IN THIS CASE? AND TO SAY TO MR. SIMPSON AT
THIS POINT IN THESE PROCEEDINGS COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF EXPLANATION OR
DEFENSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BACK OF AN AUTOMOBILE EIGHT -- SEVEN,
EIGHT YEARS AGO, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHEN IT HAPPENED, IS
AN INSURMOUNTABLE TASK FACING THE DEFENSE, AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE
THE EXTENT TO WHICH MUCH OF WHAT IS IN THIS CHRONOLOGY IS OF THE SAME
NATURE. ITEM 18. HERE WE ARE TOLD OF AN INCIDENT OF WHAT IS DESCRIBED AS
VERBAL ABUSE IN A BAR. AND THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT
VERBAL ABUSE. VERBAL ABUSE IS A NICE EUPHEMISM FOR AN ARGUMENT, AND TO
SAY THAT EVERY TIME A MARRIED COUPLE GETS INTO AN ARGUMENT, THAT IS
ABUSE OR VERBAL ABUSE, BECAUSE THEY HURL CRUEL WORDS AT EACH OTHER AND
THAT SOMEHOW BECOMES RELEVANT TO PROVE SOMETHING IN A SUBSEQUENT
CRIMINAL CASE, RAISES A SUBSTANTIAL QUESTION FOR THE COURT. AND THE
QUESTION IS NOT JUST IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DICTA IN PEOPLE VERSUS ZACK
WHICH SAYS ONLY PHYSICAL ASSAULTS BECOME ADMISSIBLE EVEN UNDER THE
BROADEST CONCEPTION OF THE RULE IMAGINABLE, BUT IT ALSO IS RELEVANT
BECAUSE ABUSE IS DEFINED AND IT IS DEFINED WITHIN THE EVIDENCE CODE.
SECTION 1107 USES THE WORD "ABUSE," AND IT SAYS:

"WHEN WE USE THE WORD 'ABUSE' WE WANT IT TO HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS
SECTION 6203 OF THE FAMILY CODE." AND HERE IS HOW SECTION 6203 OF THE
FAMILY CODE DEFINES ABUSE. IT SAYS:

"'ABUSE' MEANS INTENTIONALLY OR RECKLESSLY TO CAUSE OR ATTEMPT TO CAUSE
BODILY INJURY OR SEXUAL ASSAULT OR TO PLACE A PERSON IN REASONABLE
APPREHENSION OF IMMINENT SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO THAT PERSON OR TO
ANOTHER." SO THERE IS THE DEFINITION, THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF ABUSE THAT
IS INCORPORATED IN THE EVIDENCE CODE, AND IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
VERBAL ABUSE OR ARGUMENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR BEING CHARACTERIZED AS
ABUSE, MUCH LESS IN TERMS OF THEIR BEING RELEVANT TO PROVE ANYTHING THAT
IS GOING TO BE DISPUTED IN THIS CASE. THIS INCIDENT IN 1989, AGAIN WE
ARE GIVEN AN INCIDENT WITHOUT ANY INDICATION OF WHEN IT TOOK PLACE,
OTHER THAN WITHIN -- SOMETIME WITHIN A PERIOD OF A YEAR, APPARENTLY
INVOLVED AN EVENT IN WHICH SIX DIFFERENT PEOPLE WERE GETTING IN AND OUT
OF AN AUTOMOBILE, AND IF THIS IS GOING TO BE A REAL ISSUE THAT SOMEHOW
AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO DRIVE A CAR AND WHO IS GOING TO GET IN
WHICH OF TWO DIFFERENT CARS PROVES SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THIS MURDER TOOK
PLACE IN JUNE OF 1994, THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
SPEND IN THIS COURTROOM LITIGATING AMONG SIX DIFFERENT VERSIONS. AND I
CAN ASSURE YOU, THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT VERSIONS FROM DIFFERENT
WITNESSES OF WHAT TOOK PLACE IN TERMS OF WHO PUSHED WHO AND WHO GOT IN
WHAT CAR AND WHO DROVE AWAY IN THAT CAR. AND THE QUESTION SIMPLY IS
WHERE DOES THAT GET US? WHAT DOES IT PROVE IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED ON
JUNE 12, 1994? ITEM NO. 19 IS AGAIN A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF RANK HEARSAY, OF
SOMETHING THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON ALLEGEDLY SAID TO SOMEBODY ELSE IN
1991, AND AGAIN WE HAVE NO PLAUSIBLE EVEN SUGGESTION OF ANY HEARSAY
EXCEPTION THAT WOULD MAKE THAT ADMISSIBLE IN THESE PROCEEDINGS. ITEM 20.
ITEM 20, THE SOURCE IDENTIFIED IS EDDIE REYNOZA, AN ACTOR APPARENTLY WHO
ALLEGES HE WAS ON A SET WITH MR. SIMPSON IN MAY OF 1991, AND THEY TALKED
ABOUT CARS AND MR. SIMPSON ALLEGEDLY SAID THAT IF HE FOUND ANY OF HIS
WIFE'S BOYFRIENDS DRIVING ONE OF HIS CARS HE WOULD CUT THEIR HEADS OFF
-- CUT THEIR FUCKING HEADS OFF. OF COURSE THERE IS GOING TO BE A REAL
CREDIBILITY ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER THAT WAS ACTUALLY SAID. MR. REYNOZA
APPARENTLY IS ONE OF THOSE CHARACTERS ON THE FRINGES OF THIS CASE WHO IS
ADVANCING HIS OWN FILM CAREER BY ASSIGNING HIMSELF A STARING ROLE IN THE
CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS O.J. SIMPSON, AND APPARENTLY HE HAS ATTEMPTED TO
DO THIS IN OTHER CASES AS WELL, SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A REAL FIGHT
ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF MR. REYNOZA. BUT BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO THAT
FIGHT, I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF RELEVANCE. I MEAN,
EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT A STATEMENT OF THIS NATURE WAS MADE IN MAY OF
1991, THE FACT THAT MR. SIMPSON IS SAYING HE DOESN'T WANT BOYFRIENDS
DRIVING HIS -- HIS WIFE'S CAR OR ONE OF HIS CARS, WHAT DOES THAT TELL US
OR WHAT DOES THAT PROVE IN TERMS OF A MOTIVE FOR THIS MURDER? I MEAN, IS
THE PROSECUTION SAYING THAT THE REASON THESE TWO PEOPLE WERE MURDERED
WAS BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS DRIVING ONE OF MR. SIMPSON'S CARS? WHAT DOES IT
TELL US ABOUT THE INTENT WITH WHICH THIS MURDER WAS COMMITTED OR THE
IDENTITY OF THE PERPETRATOR? IT TELLS US ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. WHAT IT
TELLS US IS IF WE WILL BELIEVE IT, MR. SIMPSON ON OCCASION WOULD USE THE
WORD "FUCK" AND ON OTHER OCCASIONS HE WOULD GET ANGRY. IS THAT THE KIND
OF EVIDENCE ON WHICH WE WANT THIS JURY TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF
WHETHER A MAN SHOULD BE CONVICTED OF MURDER? 21. AGAIN THIS JUST --
WE'LL CONCEDE THAT. MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE DID INITIATE DIVORCE
PROCEEDINGS IN JANUARY OF 1992 AND WE MIGHT NOTE THAT IT WAS AN
UNUSUALLY AMICABLE DIVORCE. THE DIARY THAT WE HAVE REFERRED TO THAT MRS.
SIMPSON ALLEGEDLY WROTE OUT WAS NEVER USED. IT WAS NEVER OFFERED IN
EVIDENCE IN THAT PROCEEDING. IN FACT, MRS. SIMPSON NEVER TESTIFIED IN
THAT PROCEEDING. AN AGREEMENT WAS WORKED OUT. THERE WERE NEVER ANY
RESTRAINING ORDERS. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A BUMPY MARRIAGE
WITH SOME HIGH POINTS AND SOME LOW POINTS, I THINK IT IS QUITE
REMARKABLE THAT IT WAS RESOLVED IN AS AMICABLE A WAY AS IT WAS. ITEM 22.
AGAIN WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INCIDENTS THAT ALL TIE INTO THE TESTIMONY OF
ONE WITNESS, AND THAT WITNESS IS KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH, AND THE EVIDENCE
APPARENTLY IS GOING TO SHOW THAT IN EARLY 1992, WHILE THE DIVORCE
PROCEEDINGS WERE GOING ON BETWEEN MR. SIMPSON AND HIS WIFE, SHE HAD AN
AFFAIR WITH THIS MAN, KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH, WHO WAS THE MANAGER OF THE
MEZZALUNA RESTAURANT AND WHOM SHE HAD MET IN ASPEN. AND THE KEY INCIDENT
HERE IS NO. 24. IN APRIL OF 1992 THE PROSECUTION WILL CONTEND THAT MR.
SIMPSON VISITED THE PREMISES WHERE MRS. SIMPSON WAS THEN RESIDING AND
THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW, FROM A VANTAGE POINT EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO
ANYONE STANDING ON THE FRONT SIDEWALK, HE ACTUALLY OBSERVED MRS. SIMPSON
AND MR. ZLOMSOWITCH ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY. AND WHAT HAPPENED?
NOTHING. HE DID NOT INTERRUPT THEM. HE RETURNED TO THE PREMISES THE NEXT
DAY, EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN ABOUT THIS ACTIVITY TAKING PLACE WHILE HIS
CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP UPSTAIRS AND SUGGESTED THAT THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY
WAS NOT APPROPRIATE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS CHILDREN. HE ACTUALLY SHOOK
HANDS WITH MR. ZLOMSOWITCH AND EXPRESSED NO HARD FEELINGS. WHAT IS THAT
GOING TO PROVE? I MEAN, IF THE THEORY THAT THE PROSECUTION WANTS TO
PRESENT WITH RESPECT TO THIS MURDER ON JUNE 12, 1994, WAS THAT THIS WAS
SOME SORT OF ACT OF RAGE INVOLVING JEALOUSY, THEN THIS INCIDENT IN 1992
REALLY UNDERCUTS THAT THEORY. IN EFFECT IT SHOWS THAT MR. SIMPSON, EVEN
OBSERVING HIS WIFE ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH ANOTHER MAN, DID NOT
BECOME BALLISTIC, DID NOT INTERRUPT THEM, DID NOT PHYSICALLY ASSAULT
ANYONE. IN FACT, ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE WITH RESPECT TO ZLOMSOWITCH
INVOLVES NO ALLEGATION OF ANY PHYSICAL ASSAULT WHATSOEVER. IT IS SIMPLY
A REMARKABLY CIVIL REACTION TO A RATHER OUTRAGEOUS CIRCUMSTANCE. AND IN
TERMS OF INFERRING FROM THAT ANY INTENT, MOTIVE OR IDENTITY OF THE
PERPETRATOR OF THE 1994 MURDER, IT SIMPLY DOESN'T CUT IT. IT DOESN'T GET
US ANYWHERE IN TERMS OF RESOLVING THE ISSUES WE HAVE TO RESOLVE IN THIS
CASE. THE ITEMS NO. 22 AND 23. WITH RESPECT TO MR. ZLOMSOWITCH
TESTIFYING THAT ON PRIOR OCCASIONS HE HAD BEEN AT A RESTAURANT AND
OBSERVED MR. SIMPSON AT THE SAME RESTAURANT AND MR. SIMPSON ON ONE
OCCASION TOLD HIM THAT MRS. SIMPSON WAS STILL HIS WIFE AND ON ANOTHER
OCCASION ALLEGEDLY STARED AT HIM, AGAIN, JUST ASSUMING THAT THESE EVENTS
TOOK PLACE, WHAT RELEVANCE DO THEY HAVE? WHAT DO THEY TELL US IN TERMS
OF ANY MOTIVE OR INTENT REGARDING THE 1994 MURDER? THEY MAY TELL US
SOMETHING ABOUT THE 1992 INCIDENT IN WHICH MR. ZLOMSOWITCH WAS ENGAGED
IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH MRS. SIMPSON, BUT THEY DON'T TELL US ANYTHING
ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON TWO YEARS LATER IN 1994. ITEM 26. IN OCTOBER OF
1992, MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON WERE LEGALLY DIVORCED. AGAIN, THERE IS NO
DISPUTE ABOUT THAT. IT REALLY HAS LIMITED RELEVANCE IN TERMS OF THE
EVENTS OF THIS CASE. NO. 27. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ITEMS ON THIS LIST
WHERE MR. SIMPSON REPORTEDLY CALLS MRS. SIMPSON'S MOTHER, JUDITHA BROWN
IS THE MOTHER OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, AND HAS CONVERSATIONS WITH HER
ABOUT THE STATUS OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MRS. SIMPSON. THIS IS WHILE
THE DIVORCE IS GOING ON. IT DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS AT ALL UNUSUAL THAT
THERE WOULD BE THIS KIND OF FAMILY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DIVORCE
PROCEEDINGS AND ABOUT THE FEELINGS OF THE PARTIES THAT ARE ENGENDERED BY
THOSE PROCEEDINGS, BUT AGAIN, WHAT RELEVANCE DOES IT HAVE? WHERE DOES IT
GET US IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING ANY MOTIVE OR INTENT WITH RESPECT TO
THIS -- TO THIS MURDER? IT SIMPLY EXPLAINS THE PARTY'S REACTION TO THE
DIVORCE THAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH, AND THOSE REACTIONS APPEAR TO BE
QUITE NORMAL, QUITE NATURAL AND REALLY PROVIDE NO ADDITIONAL
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF ANY -- ANY MOTIVE OR INTENT. AGAIN, ITEM 28.
NO QUESTION ABOUT THIS. MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON DID ATTEMPT A
RECONCILIATION BEGINNING IN MARCH OF 1993. ITEM 29. AGAIN WE ARE BACK TO
ALLEGATIONS OF VERBAL ABUSE, THAT THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT OUTSIDE THE
CALIFORNIA SUSHI BAR, AND AGAIN THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS
ARGUMENT. IN FACT, FAYE RESNICK AND CHRISTIAN REICHARDT, THE ONLY TWO
WITNESSES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED HERE, THEMSELVES HAD VERY DIFFERENT
VERSIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. THE WITHDRAWAL OF FAYE RESNICK AS A
WITNESS I THINK RAISES ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT OFFERING THIS IN
EVIDENCE IF THERE ARE DIFFERING VERSIONS, AND THE PROSECUTION IS ONLY
GOING TO PRESENT ONE, WITHOUT PRESENTING THE OTHER WITNESS WHO HAD A
DIFFERENT VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED. I THINK THAT RAISES A FUNDAMENTAL
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO SORT OUT WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED. BUT ONE THING WE KNOW DID NOT HAPPEN. THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL
ABUSE. THIS WAS AN ARGUMENT TAKING PLACE IN FRONT OF A RESTAURANT. THE
PARTIES GOT IN A CAR AND DROVE AWAY. AND WHAT DOES THAT TELL US IN TERMS
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN JUNE OF 1994? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. ITEM 30 AND 31
RELATE TO THE TESTIMONY OF TWO NEIGHBORS WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR TO MRS.
SIMPSON BEFORE SHE MOVED TO THE BUNDY ADDRESS. THIS IS ON THE GRETNA
GREEN ADDRESS, AND THESE NEIGHBORS REPORT SEEING MR. SIMPSON OUTSIDE THE
PREMISES LOOKING IN THE WINDOWS OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S AND THE TIMING
FROM THEIR STATEMENTS AS TO WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE IS AT THE TIME OF THE
RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. ZLOMSOWITCH, SO WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS BEING
DESCRIBED HERE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT TOOK PLACE IN 1993, BUT RELATES TO
THE SAME INCIDENT, NO. 24, THAT WILL BE PRESENTED IN MR. ZLOMSOWITCH'S
TESTIMONY. WHY WAS MR. SIMPSON NEAR THE PREMISES OF MRS. SIMPSON? I
MEAN, WHAT DOES THIS PROVE, THE FACT THAT HE WOULD OCCASIONALLY BE SEEN
AT THE HOME WHERE MRS. SIMPSON WAS LIVING? I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER
THAT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE DIVORCE IN 1992, THEY WERE AWARDED JOINT
CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN, AND THE CHILDREN WERE WITH MRS. SIMPSON, SO
OBVIOUSLY HE WOULD HAVE FREQUENT OCCASION TO VISIT THE PREMISES WHERE
MRS. SIMPSON WAS LIVING, TO VISIT HIS CHILDREN. THE COLBYS ALSO
REPORTED, AND THIS IS IN YOUR SUMMARY, THAT THEY OBSERVED THE DEFENDANT
WOULD OFTEN LEAVE FLOWERS AT THE DOOR OF MRS. SIMPSON'S HOME. WHAT DOES
THAT TELL US IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN JUNE OF 1994, THAT ON PRIOR
OCCASIONS, WHEN THEY WERE ATTEMPTING A RECONCILIATION IN THEIR MARRIAGE,
MR. SIMPSON DELIVERED FLOWERS PERSONALLY TO THE HOME OF MRS. SIMPSON? IT
DOESN'T GET US VERY FAR IN TERMS OF RESOLVING ANY ISSUES IN THIS CASE.
ITEM 32 IS APPARENTLY THE SAME AS ITEM 35. I MEAN, IT JUST REPORTS SOME
GENERAL STATEMENTS BY VARIOUS PEOPLE DESCRIBING WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
1993 911 INCIDENT, THAT MR. SIMPSON BARGED INTO MRS. SIMPSON'S HOME AND
YELLED AT HER, THAT THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT NARCOTIC USAGE BY KATO
KAELIN, THAT THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF THE ZLOMSOWITCH INCIDENT. ALL OF
THAT APPARENTLY RELATES TO THE OCTOBER, 1993, INCIDENT THAT IS ITEMIZED
AS ITEM 35, AND I WILL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT. ITEM 33, AGAIN MORE
UNCORROBORATED RANK HEARSAY, JUST AN ALLEGATION THAT AT SOME POINT IN
1993, AND WE ARE NOT TOLD WHEN, MRS. SIMPSON MADE A STATEMENT TO SOME
OTHER PERSON ABOUT HER BELIEF THAT MR. SIMPSON WAS -- WAS FOLLOWING HER.
THAT IS HEARSAY. WE CAN'T CROSS-EXAMINE IT. AND ANY STATE OF MIND IN
1993, MUCH LESS IN 1994 WHEN THIS HAPPENED, IS NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE
IN THIS CASE. SO THERE IS NO REASON WHY THAT CAN EVEN BE ADMITTED UNDER
THE -- UNDER THE HEARSAY RULE. 34, WE ARE NOT EVEN GIVEN A SOURCE. THIS
IS JUST AN OUTRIGHT ALLEGATION IN THE PROSECUTION'S RESPONSE. WE BELIEVE
THE SOURCE IS ALSO HEARSAY. APPARENTLY THIS IS SOMETHING THE PROSECUTORS
PULLED OUT OF FAYE RESNICK'S BOOK TO BOLSTER THEIR RESPONSE TO THEIR
MOTION, AND MISS RESNICK APPARENTLY, WHO IS NOT GOING TO BE A WITNESS,
WAS REPORTING SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID TO HER BY THE -- BY THE VICTIM. SO
NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A HEARSAY STATEMENT, BUT THE PERSON WHO ALLEGEDLY
HEARD THAT STATEMENT ISN'T GOING TO BE A WITNESS, SO I DON'T THINK WE
NEED TO WORRY MUCH ABOUT ITEM 34. NOW, ITEM 35 BRINGS US TO THE 911
INCIDENT THAT EVERYBODY WAS TREATED TO HEARING IN GRAPHIC DETAIL WITH
THE RELEASE OF THE 911 TAPES. I'M ASSUMING YOUR HONOR HAS A COPY OF THE
TRANSCRIPT OF THAT 911 CALL, AND I THINK THIS IS A GOOD POINT WITH WHICH
TO ADDRESS THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF 911 TAPES AS AN
EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE. OF COURSE THE TAPE ITSELF IS HEARSAY.
THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE THE DECLARANT OF ANY OF THE
STATEMENTS THAT APPEAR IN THE COURSE OF THIS -- OF THIS RECORDING, BUT
THE -- THE PROSECUTION ALLEGES THAT IT COMES WITHIN THE WELL-DEFINED
EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE FOR SPONTANEOUS STATEMENTS. NOW, THE
REQUIREMENT OF STATEMENTS COMING IN UNDER THE SPONTANEOUS STATEMENT
EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE REALLY GO TO THE ASSUMPTION OF RELIABILITY
THAT COMES FROM PEOPLE SPEAKING UNDER THE STRESS OF EXCITEMENT. OF
COURSE THE -- THE IDEA BEHIND THIS EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE IS THAT
WHEN -- WHEN SOMEONE IS NOT REFLECTING ON WHAT THEY ARE SAYING, THEY ARE
JUST REACTING, THEY ARE JUST SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY ARE
OBSERVING AT THE SAME TIME THOSE THINGS ARE GOING ON AND THOSE THINGS
ARE EXCITING, THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE LESS OF A TENDENCY TO EXAGGERATE, TO
PREVARICATE, THAT WE CAN COUNT ON THESE STATEMENTS AS BEING UNUSUALLY
RELIABLE; THEREFORE, WE WILL ADMIT THEM WITHOUT THE NORMAL SAFEGUARD OF
ALLOWING CROSS-EXAMINATION. AND ORDINARILY THESE KIND OF STATEMENTS ARE
-- ARE VERY BRIEF, VERY REACTIVE KIND OF STATEMENTS, AND OF COURSE THE
PROBLEM WE HAVE, THAT IS WE HAVE A 14-MINUTE CONVERSATION, A
CONVERSATION IN WHICH THE 911 OPERATOR ASKS A NUMBER OF VERY POINTED
QUESTIONS AND GETS VERY REFLECTIVE, POINTED RESPONSES. MANY OF THESE
RESPONSES NOT ONLY HAVE PROBLEMS OF BEING HEARSAY, BUT THEY ARE
EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION. FOR EXAMPLE, "HE IS CRAZY, HE IS FUCKING GOING
NUTS, HE IS GOING TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF ME." I MEAN, THESE ARE JUST
EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION THAT ARE NOT REACTIONS TO ANYTHING THAT IS
HAPPENING OR DESCRIPTIVE OF ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED. I MEAN, THE ONE
THING WE ABSOLUTELY KNOW FOR SURE ABOUT THIS INCIDENT OF OCTOBER, 1993,
AND THAT IS THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL ABUSE. AT NO TIME IN ANY OF THESE
EVENTS DID MR. SIMPSON EVER STRIKE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, NOR IS THERE
ANY ALLEGATION THAT HE THREATENED TO STRIKE HER, NOR IS THERE ANY
EXPRESSION ON HER PART THAT SHE IS CONCERNED THAT HE IS ABOUT TO STRIKE
HER. THE CONCERN AGAIN APPEARS TO BE, WELL, WHO IS GOING TO PAY TO FIX
THE BROKEN DOOR THAT HE CAME THROUGH AND I'M WORRIED THAT HE IS GOING TO
WAKE UP THE KIDS. THOSE ARE THE MOST VEHEMENT CONCERNS EXPRESSED IN THE
COURSE OF THIS -- OF THIS CONVERSATION. AND OF COURSE THE REAL QUESTION
WE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THIS COMING IN AS EVIDENCE AS A PRIOR INCIDENT
IS WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12, 1994? WHAT IS
DESCRIBED HERE IS A VERY LOUD CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MR. SIMPSON AND
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, IN WHICH THEY ARGUED AND THE ARGUMENT WAS -- WAS
OF COURSE A VERY PUBLIC ONE IN THE SENSE THAT POLICE OFFICERS RESPONDED,
CALMED THEM DOWN. MR. KAELIN WAS PRESENT DURING -- DURING MOST OF THE
ARGUMENT. WHAT DOES THAT TELL US IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING WHAT HAPPENED ON
JUNE 12, 1994? IT TELLS US NOTHING, BUT THE POTENTIAL FOR PREJUDICE,
ESPECIALLY SOMEBODY HEARING THIS TAPE, IS ENORMOUS, BECAUSE WE CAN, JUST
FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCE, ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT WHEN THIS TAPE WAS
PLAYED ON EVERY TELEVISION SET IN THE COUNTRY, AND REPLAYED AND PLAYED
AGAIN, THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WHAT WAS GOING ON WAS A PHYSICAL ABUSE, THAT
WHAT WAS GOING ON WAS MR. SIMPSON BARGING INTO THE HOUSE AND PHYSICALLY
ASSAULTING MRS. SIMPSON. AND WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THAT DIDN'T TAKE
PLACE, THAT THIS IS NOT EVEN AN INCIDENT OF PHYSICAL ABUSE. WHAT IT IS
IS A VERY LOUD ARGUMENT BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE, AN ARGUMENT APPARENTLY ABOUT
WHETHER BOTH OF THEM HAD CONFORMED TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT PICTURES OF
THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN PRIOR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WOULD NOT BE
DISPLAYED, AND THAT IS WHAT THEY WERE ARGUING ABOUT. DOES THAT SUGGEST A
MOTIVE FOR SOMEONE TO MURDER SOMEONE A YEAR LATER OR EIGHT MONTHS LATER?
HARDLY. ITEM 36 AND 37 ARE BOTH AGAIN EXAMPLES OF HEARSAY, ALLEGATIONS
THAT MRS. SIMPSON SAID TO OTHER THIRD PARTIES THAT SHE BELIEVED THAT MR.
SIMPSON WAS -- WAS FOLLOWING HER AND SHE HAD REASON TO BE AFRAID OF HIM.
AND AGAIN, NO OPPORTUNITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE ANY OF THIS, NO SUGGESTION OF
ANY PLAUSIBLE EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE. I GUESS, WHAT THE
SUGGESTION WILL BE, THAT THIS PROVES SOMEHOW STATE OF MIND. AND AGAIN WE
ASK: WELL, WHAT RELEVANCE DOES MRS. SIMPSON'S STATE OF MIND IN 1993 HAVE
IN THIS CASE? WHAT RELEVANCE DOES HER STATE OF MIND ON THE VERY NIGHT
THAT SHE WAS HEARD HAVE IN THIS CASE? AND THE ANSWER IS NONE, JUST AS
THAT ANSWER WAS GIVEN IN THE IRELAND CASE AND IN THE ARCEGA CASE. THERE
IS NO RELEVANCE. THAT STATE OF MIND IS NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE IN THIS
CASE. ITEM 38. NO DISPUTE ABOUT THIS. IN JANUARY OF 1994 MRS. SIMPSON
DID MOVE FROM THE GRETNA GREEN HOUSE TO THE PREMISES ON BUNDY DRIVE.
ITEM 39. WE ARE TOLD THAT MR. KELLER WILL TESTIFY THAT WHILE HE WAS
HAVING COFFEE AT STARBUCK'S WITH MRS. SIMPSON AND A NUMBER OF OTHER
INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING RON GOLDMAN, THAT HE OBSERVED MR. SIMPSON DRIVING
BY. MR. SIMPSON STOPPED HIS CAR AND NICOLE WALKED OVER AND SPOKE TO HIM
IN THE AUTOMOBILE. HE CHARACTERIZED WHAT IS GOING ON AS SOME SHOUTING.
AGAIN, EVEN THAT OF COURSE WILL BE DISPUTED, BUT EVEN IF THERE WAS
SHOUTING, WHAT DOES THAT PROVE? THAT MR. SIMPSON SPOKE TO HIS WIFE IN A
LOUD VOICE ON AN OCCASION WHEN HE HAPPENED TO BE DRIVING BY WHILE SHE IS
SITTING HAVING COFFEE AT STARBUCK'S? WHAT DOES THAT TELL US? DOES THAT
SUGGEST A MOTIVE FOR A MURDER? DOES THAT SUGGEST THAT ASSUMING MR.
SIMPSON IS -- IS THE MURDERER, THAT HE HAD A PARTICULAR INTENT OR
PREMEDITATION? DOES IT SUGGEST EVEN THAT HE WAS IN FACT THE MURDERER?
DOES IT ESTABLISH HIS IDENTITY? AND OF COURSE IT DOES NONE OF THESE
THINGS. IT IS SIMPLY IRRELEVANT. ITEM 40. AGAIN A CONVERSATION WITH --
WITH MRS. SIMPSON'S MOTHER AND AGAIN HEARSAY WHICH REALLY -- AS TO WHICH
WE HAVE NO PLAUSIBLE -- I'M SORRY. THIS IS NOT A CONVERSATION BETWEEN
THE DEFENDANT AND THE MOTHER, BUT BETWEEN MRS. SIMPSON AND HER MOTHER,
SO IT IS HEARSAY, IT DOESN'T COME WITHIN ANY RECOGNIZED EXCEPTION TO THE
HEARSAY RULE. ITEM 41 IS AGAIN ANOTHER CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. SIMPSON
AND MRS. SIMPSON'S MOTHER. NO HEARSAY PROBLEM OF COURSE SINCE IT IS A
STATEMENT OF THE -- OF THE DEFENDANT. THE REAL PROBLEM IS RELEVANCE.
WHAT RELEVANCE DOES IT HAVE THAT IN THE COURSE OF AN ATTEMPT TO WORK OUT
A RECONCILIATION MR. SIMPSON SAYS TO HIS FORMER WIFE'S MOTHER THAT SHE
IS THE ONLY WOMAN HE WANTS IN HIS LIFE AND HE CAN'T HAVE HER, IF IN FACT
THAT WAS SAID, AND AGAIN, THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE CONFLICTING VERSIONS OF
WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SAID. BUT EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT THIS WAS WHAT WAS
SAID, DOES THAT ESTABLISH A MOTIVE FOR A MURDER? WITH RESPECT TO ITEM
NO. 42, THE TESTIMONY OF BILL THIBODEAU, WHO AGAIN, ONE OF THOSE
WITNESSES WHO HAS BEEN ON TELEVISION, SO HE WON'T BE PRESENTING THIS
STORY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS COURTROOM, HE HAS MADE THE ROUNDS OF
THE T.V. SHOWS, AND THERE IS A SERIOUS QUESTION GOING TO BE RAISED ABOUT
-- ABOUT HIS CREDIBILITY, ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF HIS REPORTS OF WHAT WAS
SAID, BUT EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT EVERYTHING THAT HE ALLEGEDLY SAYS MR.
SIMPSON SAID, IT DOESN'T OFFER ANY ELUCIDATION IN TERMS OF A POTENTIAL
MOTIVE. IT IS SIMPLY RELEVANT. IT GETS US NOWHERE IN TERMS OF RESOLVING
THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO RESOLVE IN THIS CASE. ITEM 43, AGAIN THIS IS
FAYE RESNICK, AND THERE MAY BE OTHER WITNESSES OTHER THAN FAYE RESNICK
WHO WILL DESCRIBE AN INCIDENT APPARENTLY IN MEXICO WHILE THEY ARE ON
VACATION WHERE MR. SIMPSON ALLEGEDLY RIDICULES HIS WIFE'S FEAR OF FROGS
AND POINTS OUT THE IRONY THAT HE IS NOW STARING IN A NEW T.V. SERIES
CALLED FROGMAN. IS THIS A MOTIVE? WHAT DOES THIS TELL US? IT TELLS US
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT IS IN ANY WAY RELEVANT TO ANY ISSUE THAT WE HAVE
TO RESOLVE IN THIS CASE, SO OUR OBJECTION IS SIMPLY THAT IT IS
IRRELEVANT. ITEM 44, ITEM 49, ITEM 51 ARE ALL ITEMS THAT ARE
ATTRIBUTABLE TO NO ONE OTHER THAN FAYE RESNICK, AND THE ANNOUNCED
INTENTION OF THE PROSECUTION THAT THEY WILL NOT CALL FAYE RESNICK SHOULD
DISPOSE OF THESE MATTERS, SINCE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH ANY OF
THESE ITEMS COULD BE -- COULD BE PROVEN. AND OF COURSE THAT IS TRUE OF
45, TOO; 44, 45, 49 AND 51. ITEM 46 AND 48 ARE BOTH HEARSAY. IN ONE CASE
WE ARE TOLD TO WHOM THESE STATEMENTS WERE MADE BY MISS SIMPSON, AND IN
THE OTHER CASE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW TO WHOM THEY WERE TOLD, ALTHOUGH WE
SUSPECT IT IS AGAIN FAYE RESNICK. IT IS JUST RANK HEARSAY. WHAT DOES IT
PROVE? STATE OF MIND IS THE ONLY POTENTIAL EXCEPTION THAT COMES TO MIND,
AND STATE OF MIND SIMPLY ISN'T AT ISSUE IN THIS CASE. ITEM 47, THERE IS
NO DISPUTE ABOUT THAT. THE ATTEMPT AT A RECONCILIATION DID END IN MAY OF
1994. ITEM 50. WE ARE TOLD ABOUT A LETTER ALLEGEDLY FROM MR. SIMPSON'S
ATTORNEY, SKIP TAFT, RESTATING A THREAT TO INFORM THE IRS OF SOME
DIFFICULTY WITH RESPECT TO A DEDUCTION WITH REGARD TO THE SALE AND
PURCHASE OF A RESIDENCE BY MRS. SIMPSON. I HOPE YOUR HONOR WILL TAKE A
LOOK AT THAT LETTER, BECAUSE THAT IS NOT REALLY WHAT THE LETTER SAYS OR
IMPLIES. IT IS NOT A LETTER FROM MR. TAFT; IT IS A LETTER FROM MR.
SIMPSON, SO THERE IS NO HEARSAY PROBLEM. IT IS ON HIS OWN LETTERHEAD AND
HE EXPRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT MISREPRESENTATIONS BEING MADE IN WHICH IN
ORDER TO AVOID THE PAYMENT OF TAXES, MRS. SIMPSON WAS CLAIMING THAT MR.
SIMPSON'S HOME WAS HER PRINCIPAL ADDRESS. AND THIS SIMPLY INFORMS HER
THAT THAT IS GOING TO PRESENT SOME COMPLICATIONS AND THAT SHE SHOULD
MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. THERE WERE NO THREATS IN THIS LETTER. THERE WAS
NO ATTEMPT TO USE THIS IN ANY WAY TO GET HER TO DO ANYTHING. IT SIMPLY
STATED WHAT WAS AN OBVIOUS FACT, THAT THAT KIND OF MISREPRESENTATION
COULD PRESENT PROBLEMS FOR BOTH OF THEM, AND SOME OTHER ARRANGEMENTS
SHOULD BE MADE, AND AGAIN WE WOULD ASK WHAT RELEVANCE THAT HAS IN TERMS
OF ANY OF THE EVENTS THAT WE HAVE TO LITIGATE IN THIS CASE ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED ON JUNE 12? ITEMS 52 AND 53. AGAIN RANK HEARSAY. EVERY ONE OF
THESE ITEMS IS SOMETHING THAT MRS. SIMPSON ALLEGEDLY SAID TO SOME THIRD
PARTY. IN ONE CASE DENISE BROWN, IN THE OTHER CASE, BETSY ROCKETT, AND
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHERE IS THE EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE? THESE
ARE NOT STATEMENTS THAT CAN BE CROSS-EXAMINED AND STATE OF MIND IS NOT
GOING TO BE AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE. ITEM 54, THE SAME THING. MORE
HEARSAY. THIS TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THE HEARSAY WAS ALLEGEDLY CORA
FICHMAN AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW GETTING CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL DATE
OF THE MURDER, THAT SOMEHOW THAT MAKES STATE OF MIND MORE RELEVANT, WE
WOULD SIMPLY UNDERLINE THE HOLDINGS IN THE CASES IN IRELAND AND ARCEGA
DEALING WITH STATEMENTS MADE VIRTUALLY THE SAME DAY THAT THE MURDER TOOK
PLACE AND THE COURT SAID IT IS STILL NOT AN ISSUE IN THE MURDER CASE AS
TO WHAT THE VICTIM'S STATE OF MIND WAS, AND THAT IS TRUE IN THIS CASE.
NOBODY IS GOING TO MAKE AN ISSUE ABOUT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S OR RONALD
GOLDMAN'S STATE OF MIND AT THE TIME THEY WERE MURDERED. ITEMS 55, 56 AND
57. THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ANY DISPUTE ABOUT ANY OF THOSE. THOSE ALL
RELATE TO THE EVENTS ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 12, EXCEPT IT IS NOT QUITE
ACCURATE TO SAY THEY SEPARATELY ATTENDED A DANCE RECITAL. THEY WERE BOTH
AT THE RECITAL. THEY WERE SEATED WITHIN TWO ROWS OF EACH OTHER. THE
REFERENCE TO THE DEFENDANT NOT BEING INVITED TO DINNER, THE DEFENDANT
DIDN'T ASK TO BE INVITED TO DINNER. THE RELEVANCE OF THAT REALLY ESCAPES
US, AND OF COURSE THE MURDER OCCURRED LATER THAT EVENING. ITEM 58 AND 59
AGAIN RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE RELEVANCE OF THE STATEMENTS
MADE BY MR. SIMPSON AT THE FUNERAL OF HIS WIFE ARE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE
WOULD SERIOUSLY CONTEND THAT IN ANY WAY THESE WERE AN ADMISSION, THAT
THE PEOPLE HE WAS SPEAKING TO IN INDICATING THE -- THE GRIEF THAT HE WAS
EXPERIENCING AND SAYING THAT HE LOVED HIS WIFE IS SOMEHOW IMPLIEDLY AN
ADMISSION THAT HE KILLED HER. THAT IS JUST SIMPLY STRETCHING THINGS
BEYOND ANY CREDULITY AND SIMILARLY. THE CALL THAT HE MADE TO THE FAMILY
WHEN HE WAS RETURNING FROM CHICAGO DID NOT IMPLY ANY SORT OF ADMISSION
AND WE ARE JUST RAISING A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THIS HAS ANY RELEVANCE
AT ALL IN TERMS OF -- OF WHAT PURPOSE -- THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS
BEING OFFERED. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ADDED EVENTS, AS I INDICATED EARLIER.
THE CHALLENGE TO MR. SIMPSON TO EXPLAIN HIS WHOLE LIFE GROWS DAY BY DAY,
AND WE NOW HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, ADDENDUM TO THE PEOPLE'S
RESPONSE WITH RESPECT TO TWO NEIGHBORS WHO IN 1978 OR 1979 -- BEAR IN
MIND THAT THIS IS SEVEN YEARS BEFORE MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON WERE EVEN
MARRIED, THIS IS WHILE THEY WERE LIVING TOGETHER BEFORE THEY WERE EVEN
MARRIED -- TWO NEIGHBORS, THROUGH THE BEDROOM WALL, REPORT THAT THEY
HEARD A VERY LOUD ARGUMENT AND THAT ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION THEY
OBSERVED MRS. SIMPSON HAD BLACK EYES.

WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT. IT -- CERTAINLY IT HAS NO
RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER TO ANYTHING THAT TOOK PLACE SIXTEEN YEARS LATER ON
JUNE 12 OF 1994. IT CERTAINLY CAN'T BE SUGGESTED THAT THIS OFFERS ANY
THEORY OF A MOTIVE OR PROVES INTENT OR PROVES THE IDENTITY OF THE
PERPETRATOR OF A MURDER SIXTEEN YEARS LATER. AND AUTHENTICATING THIS IN
TERMS OF WHO WAS EVEN IN THAT BEDROOM IS GOING TO BE AN INSURMOUNTABLE
TASK THAT WILL PRESENT A SERIOUS 403 QUESTION WHETHER THIS WILL EVEN BE
ADMISSIBLE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LITIGATE WHETHER IN FACT WHAT THEY
WERE HEARING WAS EVEN AN ARGUMENT BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON, MUCH
LESS WHETHER THAT ARGUMENT HAS ANY RELEVANCE TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. THE
OTHER ADD-ON WAS AGAIN AN EVENT -- ALLEGED EVENT THAT WILL RAISE A
SUBSTANTIAL 403 QUESTION AS TO WHETHER IT EVER TOOK PLACE. WE ARE TOLD
THAT MR. SIMPSON IS NOW GOING TO HAVE TO SEARCH HIS MEMORY FOR THE
ENTIRE YEAR OF 1986 AND 1987 AS TO ANY OCCASIONS ON WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN AT THE BEACH WITH MRS. SIMPSON, AND -- AND THE INCREDIBLE
ALLEGATION IS THAT ON A PUBLIC BEACH IN THE PRESENCE OF PRESUMABLY
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MR. SIMPSON STRUCK HIS WIFE AND KNOCKED HERB TO THE
GROUND. I THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL ISSUE OF THE ABILITY
OF THIS WITNESS TO ACTUALLY MAKE AN IDENTIFICATION NINE YEARS LATER.
SUDDENLY THIS PERSON REMEMBERS, NINE YEARS AGO I WAS AT THE BEACH AND I
SAW O.J. SIMPSON HIT HIS WIFE. WELL, EVEN IF THAT IS CREDIBLE, EVEN IF
THAT IS BELIEVABLE, WE HAVE TO ASK WHAT DOES IT PROVE? WHAT IS THE
RELEVANCE? HOW DOES THAT ESTABLISH ANY MOTIVE, ANY INTENT OR THE
IDENTITY OF ANYONE INVOLVED IN A MURDER ON JUNE 12, 1994? THE OTHER
RECENT DEVELOPMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOJOURN ITEM THAT WAS JUST
PRESENTED IN COURT THIS MORNING, AGAIN, JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ATTEMPT
TO USE HEARSAY IN THIS CASE, WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO CROSS-EXAMINATION,
APART FROM ALL OF THE PROBLEMS OF AUTHENTICATION OF WHO THIS ACTUALLY
WAS REFERRED TO IN THAT -- IN THAT REPORT. EVEN IF THOSE PROBLEMS ARE
OVERCOME, THE QUESTION IS IT IS HEARSAY. WHAT HEARSAY EXCEPTION DOES IT
COME WITHIN? SO YOUR HONOR, WHEN WE BOIL IT ALL DOWN, WHAT WE HAVE IN
THIS -- IN THIS CHRONOLOGY IS AN AWFUL LOT OF HEARSAY, UNCORROBORATED
HEARSAY, HEARSAY THAT THE DEFENDANT CANNOT CROSS-EXAMINE, HEARSAY THAT
COMES WITHIN NO RECOGNIZED EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE, THE ONLY
POTENTIAL EXCEPTION BEING STATE OF MIND, WHICH IS NOT IN ISSUE IN THIS
CASE, AND IT CAN'T BE MADE AN ISSUE JUST TO BOOTSTRAP THIS EVIDENCE. THE
PROSECUTION CAN'T SOMEHOW CONSTRUCT SOME CONVOLUTED THEORY OF THE
EVIDENCE THAT MAKES THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIM AN ISSUE JUST AS A
DEVICE TO PULL IN ALL OF THESE ITEMS OF UNCORROBORATED HEARSAY. WE HAVE
A LOT OF ITEMS AS TO WHICH THERE WILL BE NO WITNESSES AT TRIAL, BECAUSE
THE PROSECUTION HAS ANNOUNCED THEY ARE NOT CALLING FAYE RESNICK AND FAYE
RESNICK IS THE ONLY REPORTED WITNESS TO THESE INCIDENTS. WE HAVE A
NUMBER OF STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEFENDANT OF HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE
RELEVANCE THAT REALLY OFFER NO INSIGHT INTO ANY STATE OF MIND OF THE
DEFENDANT THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT ON JUNE 12, 1994. AND WHAT WE DO HAVE
IN TERMS OF ANY INCIDENTS THAT CAN, BY THE WILDEST CHARACTERIZATION BE
CALLED INCIDENTS OF ABUSE, DO NOT INVOLVE PHYSICAL ABUSE IN MOST OF THE
CASES, THE SINGLE EXCEPTION BEING THE 1989 INCIDENT IN WHICH MR. SIMPSON
WAS PLACED ON PROBATION, MANY OF WHICH ARE VERY REMOTE TO ANYTHING THAT
TOOK PLACE IN THIS CASE, LONG BEFORE 1994. IN FACT, IT IS REMARKABLE
THAT THERE ARE SO FEW IN THE COURSE OF A 17-YEAR RELATIONSHIP, AND YET
INCIDENTS THAT COULD BE VERY PREJUDICIAL, VERY TIME-CONSUMING, VERY
CONFUSING TO THE JURY IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY ARE TO MAKE OF ANY OF THIS.
WHAT WE END UP WITH IS A BUMPY MARRIAGE IN WHICH THE PARTIES ARGUED A
LOT, PROBABLY NO MORE THAN USUAL IN -- IN MANY MARRIAGES. ALL OF THE
GOOD MOMENTS OF THAT MARRIAGE ARE LEFT OUT, AND PROBABLY THE LOW POINTS
ARE THE 1989 NEW YEAR'S PARTY INCIDENT, THE ZLOMSOWITCH INCIDENT IN
1992, AND THE ARGUMENT OVER THE BROKEN DOOR IN 1993. AND WITH RESPECT TO
EACH OF THOSE INCIDENTS, THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IS HOW
SIMILAR ARE ANY OF THESE INCIDENTS TO WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12, 1994,
WHEN TWO PEOPLE WERE BRUTALLY STABBED TO DEATH ON A SIDEWALK OUTSIDE OF
THEIR HOME? HOW DOES ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN A PUSHING AND SHOVING
ARGUMENT FOLLOWING A NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY RESOLVE ANY OF THE ISSUES WE
HAVE TO RESOLVE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12? HOW DOES ANY EVIDENCE
ABOUT THE CONFRONTATION OF A MAN ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH HIS
WIFE ILLUMINATE WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12, 1994? AND HOW DOES A LOUD
ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PICTURES ARE IN A FAMILY ALBUM LEADING TO
THE BREAKING OF A DOOR IN 1993 ILLUMINATE ANY OF THOSE ISSUES? NO MATTER
WHAT LABEL YOU PUT ON THESE INCIDENTS, IF YOU WANT TO CALL THEM SPOUSAL
ABUSE, EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T MEET THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF SPOUSAL
ABUSE, WHERE DOES THAT TAKE US IN TERMS OF THE REAL ISSUE THAT WE WANT
TO LITIGATE IN THIS TRIAL? AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF WHO KILLED NICOLE
BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD GOLDMAN.

AND WE SUBMIT THAT NONE OF THIS EVIDENCE IS GOING TO TAKE US DOWN THE
ROAD TO ANSWERING THAT QUESTION IN THIS TRIAL. MAY I CONFER WITH
CO-COUNSEL?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. GORDON:* WE WILL NEED JUST A MOMENT.

*MR. UELMEN:* THERE IS ONE ISSUE I DID NOT ADDRESS IN MY ORAL ARGUMENT
AND I DON'T WANT YOUR HONOR TO ASSUME THAT WE ARE WITHDRAWING OUR
OBJECTION TO THE USE OF THE TERMS "SPOUSAL ABUSE/BATTERED WIFE" IN THE
COURSE OF THIS TRIAL. WE ALSO BELIEVE THOSE TERMS CARRY WITH THEM AN
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BAGGAGE AND THEY NEED TO BE VERY CAREFULLY DEFINED IN
TERMS OF WHAT THEY MEAN AND HOW THEY ARE USED. AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED
THAT THE JURORS NOT BRING INTO THIS CASE ANY BAGGAGE THAT THEY MAY
ASSOCIATE IN TERMS OF THIS NATURE THAT ARE INAPPROPRIATE TO DESCRIBE ANY
OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE. THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. GORDON.

*MR. GORDON:* COULD WE HAVE JUST A MOMENT TO BRING SOME GRAPHICS ON?

*THE COURT:* SURE.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* MR. GORDON, HAVE YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW IT TO
COUNSEL?

*MR. GORDON:* ABOUT TO RIGHT NOW.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I WAS JUST ASKING HIM THAT.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND
DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY WE APPROACH, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* WITH THE COURT REPORTER, PLEASE.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD AT THE BENCH:)

*THE COURT:* MR. COCHRAN, DO YOU WANT TO LODGE SOME SORT OF OBJECTION?

*MR. COCHRAN:* FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO SAY, YOUR HONOR, WHEN I WAS IN
THE D.A.'S OFFICE IN 1978 I WAS THE FIRST CHAIRMAN IN THIS COUNTY OF THE
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSEL AND I HOPE THIS ISN'T THE END RESULT OF ALL MY
WORK.

*MS. BODIN:* YOU WILL BE PROUD.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I HEARD FROM MR. GORDON, AND WE HAVE SEEN THE EXHIBIT
NOW, YOUR HONOR, AND IF THE EXHIBITS ARE FOR YOUR HONOR, THERE IS NO
INDICATION YOUR HONOR HAS ANY PROBLEM SEEING. AS YOU SAID BACK IN
CHAMBERS, I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO YOU SEEING EVERYTHING AND PERUSING
EVERYTHING. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ARE SO BIG AT THIS POINT.

*THE COURT:* UH-HUH.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I DON'T THINK YOU NEED THEM AND THE JURY IS NOT HERE.
THAT IS MY FIRST CONCERN.

*THE COURT:* MAYBE IT IS A COMMENT BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ON
MY BLISTERING LACK OF ABILITY TO COMPREHEND THEIR ARGUMENTS.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF YOU DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND
THEIR ARGUMENT. THEY ALSO PURPORT TO CALL OR TALK ABOUT CALLING AN
EXPERT. THEY SEARCHED THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY AND COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY IN
THE UNITED STATES AND THEY SOME CHARTS THERE WHICH I HAVE A QUESTION OF
RELEVANCY.

*THE COURT:* BUT AFTER NAFTA WE CAN GO ANYWHERE WE WANT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I SUPPOSE YOU CAN, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF OUR JURY WILL
RELATE TO A CITIZEN FROM THE NORTH, I GUESS HE COULD, BUT THIS MAN IS
FROM CANADA.

*MR. GORDON:* THAT SHOULD BE BETTER.

*MR. COCHRAN:* IF HE IS GOING TO CALL EXPERT TESTIMONY, THEN I THINK WE
NEED AN OFFER OF PROOF ON THAT. I MEAN, THERE IS NO SHOWING THAT THIS
COURT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THIS IS A MURDER CASE AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND --
THEY HAVE GOT THIS THEORY AND I THINK THAT SOMEBODY USED THE WORDS
"INSULTING" AND THE PROSECUTION WOULDN'T INSULT YOU, I KNOW, BUT THERE
IS FAR FROM ANY SHOWING THAT YOU NEED ANY HELP FROM AN EXPERT REGARDING
THE BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME, THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF HELPLESSNESS AND ALL
THOSE THINGS. SO I THINK WE NEED AN OFFER PROOF AND I'M GOING TO ASK FOR
ONE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT, JUDGE, THIS IS
GOING OUT OVER THE AIRWAVES AND THEY ARE FURTHER PREJUDICING THE PUBLIC.
IT WON'T AFFECT OUR JURY NOW BUT IT IS IRRELEVANT AND IMMATERIAL UNLESS
IT HELPS YOU OUT. YOU ARE MAKING THIS DECISION.

*MR. DARDEN:* IS THAT A LEGAL OBJECTION AT THIS POINT, THAT WE MIGHT
PREJUDICE THE PUBLIC?

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES, IT IS, BECAUSE IT IS IRRELEVANT AND IMMATERIAL IF IT
IS JUST FOR THE PUBLIC CONSUMPTION.

*THE COURT:* MR. GORDON.

*MR. GORDON:* FIRST OF ALL, THE JURY IS SEQUESTERED, SO THE NOTION OF
THE PREJUDICE I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY LEGAL CONCERN WHATSOEVER.
SECONDLY, WITH REGARD TO THE EXPERT TESTIMONY, WE'VE HEARD AN ENTIRE
ARGUMENT BASED TODAY THAT ALL WE NEED TO DO IS SHOW A SIMILAR CONNECTION
BETWEEN CERTAIN ACTS WITH REGARD TO INTENT, DESIGN OR MOTIVE, AND THAT
IS EXACTLY, EXACTLY WHAT THIS TESTIMONY GOES TO SHOW. AND THIS EXPERT
WILL EXPLAIN HOW THESE ACTS ARE ABSOLUTELY LINKED, ABSOLUTELY PUT
TOGETHER, HAVE THE SAME DESIGN, THE SAME INTENT AND THE SAME MOTIVE.
THAT IS WHAT WE WERE REQUESTED TO DO AND WE ARE RESPONDING TO THAT
REQUEST. WITH REGARD TO THE CHART SIZE, I DON'T HAVE TO RESPOND TO THAT
HERE. I ASKED SOMEBODY TO DO A CHART, THAT IS WHAT CAME BACK. IT IS NOT
MEANT TO INSULT THE COURT AT ALL.

*THE COURT:* I'M SURE YOU ARE PLANNING TO USE IT FOR A DIFFERENT
AUDIENCE SOME TIME LATER.

*MR. GORDON:* I THINK THAT IS WHAT IT IS, SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT A
SECOND TIME.

*THE COURT:* I'M GOING TO DIRECT YOU TO TURN THE EASEL SO IT FACES ME SO
IT IS NOT IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PHOTOGRAPHERS IN THE BACK.

*MR. GORDON:* THAT IS WHAT I INTENDED TO DO WITH THIS.

*THE COURT:* I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT NEEDS TO SEE THIS.

*MR. DARDEN:* BEFORE WE LEAVE SIDE BAR, CAN I JUST SHOW COUNSEL THE '89
PHOTOGRAPHS? AND THEY HAVE JUST BEEN DELIVERED JUST NOW.

*MR. BAILEY:* DO YOU WANT TIME TO ENHANCE --

*MR. COCHRAN:* JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIES, JUST RAN IN WITH THESE.

*MR. DARDEN:* I'VE GOT JUICE IN THE D.A.'S OFFICE NOW, DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE HAVE JUICE; YOU DON'T HAVE JUICE.

*MR. GORDON:* I JUST WANT TO FINISH THE OBJECTION. COUNSEL HAS JUST
FINISHED MAKING AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE ACTS THAT HE HAS DESCRIBED AND
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE GOING TO USE -- USE OUR TERMS OF ADVOCACY TO DESCRIBE
THEM. THEY ARE THINGS IN A NORMAL MARRIAGE DON'T REPRESENT. A LOT OF
ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITHOUT ANY KIND OF EMPIRICAL DATA AT ALL. THE
COURT SAID IT COULD CONSIDER EMPIRICAL DATA. I THINK IT IS BETTER TO
BRING IN A SOURCE WHO IS VERY FAMILIAR --

*THE COURT:* LET'S SEE -- WHETHER WE GET TO THAT THE ISSUE IS WHETHER OR
NOT BWS IS GOING TO BE ADMISSIBLE, SO WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL HILL WE HAVE
TO GET OVER BEFORE WE GET TO THAT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 1107.

*MR. GORDON:* ACTUALLY I THINK THERE IS TWO ISSUES, YOUR HONOR. I THINK
YOU ARE RIGHT, ONE IS BWS OR ANY TESTIMONY EXPERT TESTIMONY WITH REGARD
TO BATTERING ADMISSIBLE IN THE TRIAL, AND I WILL CERTAINLY ADDRESS THAT,
BUT THERE IS A SECOND STAGE WHICH IS THE USE TO HELP ANY -- TO ASSESS
THE TRIER OF FACT IN THIS STAGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS MOTION TO
UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTIONS. AND AT THIS POINT THAT IS WHAT I'M OFFERING
IT FOR, IS TO EXPLAIN THE EVIDENCE HERE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THE PROBLEM YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE, THOUGH, AND
THIS IS NOT A RULING, JUST AN OBSERVATION, BUT THE STATUTE DOES SAY IT
IS NOT ADMISSIBLE TO PROVE THAT THE PERSON DID THIS ACT THAT WE ARE ON
TRIAL.

*MR. GORDON:* I UNDERSTAND.

*THE COURT:* SO YOU HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A RELEVANCE -- I MEAN, I ASSUME YOU
ARE GOING TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT BWS IS ADMISSIBLE TO EXPLAIN THE
VICTIM'S CONDUCT AFTER THE '89 INCIDENTS AND DURING THE COURSE OF THE
'93 INCIDENTS, I ASSUME.

*MR. GORDON:* I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN BWS.

*THE COURT:* THAT IS SORT OF PRETTY LIMITED PURPOSE.

*MR. GORDON:* I'M GOING TO BE ARGUING 1107 WITH REGARD TO LEGISLATIVE
INTENT. MISS BODIN, WHO WAS PRESENT DURING EVERY HEARING ON THAT
STATUTE, WROTE A MAJORITY OF THE AMENDMENTS IN THAT STATUTE, IS HERE
THAT WILL DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY RESPOND TO THAT WHEN I GET TO THAT POINT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. GORDON:* THAT IS NOT WHAT THE EXPERT IS BEING OFFERED FOR RIGHT NOW.

*THE COURT:* AT THIS POINT LET'S TURN THE PLACARDS TOWARD THE COURT,
SINCE IT IS NOT FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AT THIS POINT ALSO I THINK THE EXPERT SHOULD BE EXCUSED.
HE IS NOT NEEDED YET, SO I WOULD ASK THAT HE BE EXCUSED IF THEY ARE
GOING TO MAKE SOME FURTHER ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT HE IS GOING TO STATE, AND
I WOULD LIKE FOR HIM TO NOT WATCH TELEVISION AND BE EXCUSED. HE IS NOT A
FAMILY MEMBER. WE DON'T THINK THAT IS APPROPRIATE.

*THE COURT:* THIS TYPE OF EXPERT TESTIMONY, THOUGH -- I MEAN, WE KNOW
WHAT THE FACTS OF THIS CASE ARE AND STATISTICS AREN'T GOING TO CHANGE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* SO --

*THE COURT:* I DECLINE THAT INVITATION.

*MR. GORDON:* CAN WE CALL HIM AT THIS TIME, YOUR HONOR?

*MR. COCHRAN:* HOW CAN YOU CALL HIM?

*THE COURT:* WE NEED TO GET TO FUNDAMENTALS BEFORE WE GET TO THAT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THAT MAY NOT BE TODAY, I DON'T THINK.

*MR. GORDON:* OKAY.

(PAGES 10626 THROUGH 10633, VOLUME 68A, TRANSCRIBED AND SEALED UNDER
SEPARATE COVER.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*THE COURT:* LET'S TAKE OUR AFTERNOON RECESS AT THIS POINT AND GET SET UP.

(RECESS.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY:)

*MR. GORDON:* CAN WE APPROACH FOR JUST A MOMENT, SIR?

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

*THE COURT:* GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN, COUNSEL.

*MR. GORDON:* GOOD AFTERNOON, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. MR. SIMPSON IS
AGAIN PRESENT WITH COUNSEL, MR. SHAPIRO, MR. COCHRAN, MR. BAILEY, MR.
UELMEN, PEOPLE REPRESENTED BY MR. GORDON, MS. BODIN AND MR. GOLDBERG.
THE MATTER IS HERE FOR CONTINUING MOTION, IN LIMINE PROCEEDINGS. AND,
MR. GORDON, YOU'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SET UP YOUR GRAPHICS FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THE COURT?

*MR. GORDON:* YES, SIR.

*THE COURT:* YOU MAY PROCEED.

*MR. GORDON:* THANK YOU. YOUR HONOR, THIS MORNING, IN MR. UELMEN'S
COMMENTS, HE KEPT REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS A MURDER CASE, THAT
THESE INSTANCES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND WILL DISCUSS TODAY BEAR NO
RELEVANCE, HAVE NO SIMILARITY WHATSOEVER. THE POINT THAT IS BEING MISSED
AND WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN THIS CASE AND IN ALL CASES OF SPOUSAL
ABUSE AND SPOUSAL HOMICIDE IS THAT THE EVENTS THAT TAKE PLACE THAT LEAD
UP TO THAT HOMICIDE ARE COMPLETELY TOTALLY WELDED AND LINKED TO THAT
TERMINAL ACT. THE DEFENSE IS RIGHT, THIS IS A MURDER CASE. WHERE THE
DIFFERENCE IS IS THAT WHAT MUST BE RECOGNIZED IS THAT THIS MURDER TOOK
17 YEARS TO COMMIT. IN A HOUSEHOLD -- IN ANY HOME OR HOUSEHOLD IN WHICH
VIOLENCE BECOMES PART OF THAT RELATIONSHIP, THOSE PUNCHES, SLAPS, THAT
PUSHING IS A PRELUDE TO A HOMICIDE. THAT HAS TO BE RECOGNIZED. IT IS
DOCUMENTED. IT HAS BEEN EMPIRICALLY RESEARCHED, AND WE'LL DEMONSTRATE
THAT. THE PATTERN OF ABUSE AND CONTROL WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON IS TEXTBOOK.
IT MIRRORS AND ILLUSTRATES WHAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED OVER THE YEARS
STARTING WITH DR. WALKER, WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT, THE DEFENSE HAS TALKED
ABOUT AND HAS BEEN ILLUSTRATED IN THE YEAR SINCE HER INITIAL RESEARCH.
THE DEFENSE KEEPS -- CHARACTERIZES THIS EVIDENCE OF PRIOR HISTORY OF
ABUSE AS CHARACTER EVIDENCE. THIS IS TRANSACTIONAL EVIDENCE, YOUR HONOR,
AND THAT'S WHAT ZACK TALKS ABOUT. AND WE WILL EXPLAIN LATER HOW IT
WORKS. THIS EVIDENCE IS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION. IT CERTAINLY HAS
RELEVANCE, AND IN THERE CERTAINLY ARE THEORIES OF ADMISSIBILITY UNDER
TRADITIONAL 1101(B) ANALYSIS. BUT BEFORE YOU GET THERE, IT HAS TO BE
RECOGNIZED THAT THE PATTERN IN A -- PATTERN OF ABUSE THAT LEADS UP TO
THE DEATH OF A SPOUSE, DEATH OF AN INTIMATE CAN NOT BE TORN AWAY OR
BROKEN AWAY FROM THAT TERMINAL ACT OF ABUSE PER HER DEATH, HER MURDER.
THE DEFENSE HAS STATED THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP IN ANY OF THESE ACTS, IN
ANY OF THESE ACTS OF ABUSE, THE DEATH ACCOMPLISHED AGAINST HIS WIFE IS
NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT AND A HOMICIDE. THIS MORNING, MR. UELMEN
ARGUED THAT THERE ARE NO CHARACTERISTICS -- THAT THE MURDER THAT WE HAD
OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD GOLDMAN WAS NOT A TYPICAL DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE MURDER. THOSE ARGUMENTS THIS MORNING WERE ANALOGIZED TO A DRUG
SCENE MURDER. THERE WAS NO DATA OFFERED WHATSOEVER WITH THAT, AND IN
FACT IT'S COMPLETELY WRONG. IT'S COMPLETELY WRONG. ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT IS VERY CONCERNING ABOUT ANY CASE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT'S AT THE INITIAL STAGES WITH AN ASSAULT UP TO A
HOMICIDE, IS THAT THERE ARE MANY MISCONCEPTIONS WITHIN THE PUBLIC ABOUT
SPOUSAL ABUSE. SPOUSAL ABUSE IS A CRIME, SOMETHING THAT OCCURS WITHIN
SECRET, WITHIN THE SHADOWS. IT CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD WHEN IT'S BROUGHT
OUT INTO THE LIGHT. AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE TODAY ARE EXACTLY,
EXACTLY THE MISCONCEPTIONS WHICH HAVE LED TO THE NEED FOR TESTIMONY,
EXPERT TESTIMONY. THERE'S LITERATURE THAT'S COME UP TO MINIMIZE
INCIDENTS, TO ARGUE THAT ABUSE IS NOT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, TO ARGUE THAT
BOTH PARTIES WERE JUST DRINKING, THEY WERE JUST WRESTLING, ALL IT WAS
WAS PHYSICAL DAMAGE WHEN SOMEONE IS SITTING INSIDE A CAR AND HAS HER
HUSBAND, AN EX-PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER HITTING THAT CAR WITH A
BASEBALL BAT, WORRYING ABOUT THE WINDSHIELD, HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST.
THOSE KINDS OF TRADITIONAL SITUATIONS OF VIOLENCE AND ABUSE, THAT KIND
OF -- THE VICTIM BLAMING THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR ON THE PUBLIC'S
MISCONCEPTIONS IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM IN THIS CASE, EXACTLY THE PROBLEM
IN MANY CASES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WITH REGARD TO THE SIMILARITIES THAT
COUNSEL HAS ASKED FOR, WHAT A TRADITIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMICIDE
LOOKS LIKE, THAT HAS BEEN STUDIED. ONE LENGTHY STUDY WAS DONE IN ONTARIO
IN 1992 AS PREPARED FOR THE ONTARIO WOMEN'S AUXILIARY. IT WAS A STUDY IN
WHICH ALL WOMEN KILLED BETWEEN 1974 AND 1990 IN ONTARIO, CANADA CASES
WERE DIRECT RESULTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THE STUDIES I AM GOING TO
BE TALKING ABOUT HAVE BEEN REPLICATED AND DUPLICATED FROM NUMEROUS OTHER
STUDIES; SOME ARE UNITED STATES STUDIES, SOME ARE CANADIAN STUDIES AND
SOME ARE AUSTRALIAN STUDIES. IN FACT, THE SAMPLING, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL
THE STUDIES, WHICH FIND IDENTICAL RESULTS, IS UP TO AROUND 3,000 SPOUSAL
ASSAULTS THAT HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT. IT'S VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT DATA.
WHAT THE STUDIES SHOW IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF
SPOUSAL HOMICIDE, AND THEY'RE ILLUSTRATED ON THE CHART WE PRESENT. FIRST
OF ALL, IT MUST BE RECOGNIZED THAT WOMEN THAT ARE KILLED, THE MAJORITY
OF THEM ARE KILLED BY INTIMATES. AND BY INTIMATES, I'M TALKING ABOUT
THAT PRIOR EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIP IN THEIR LIFE, HUSBAND, BOYFRIEND,
EX-BOYFRIEND, THAT PRIMARY LOVE RELATIONSHIP. IN FACT, IN THE STUDY THAT
WAS DONE IN ONTARIO, SOME 61 PERCENT OF ALL THE WOMEN KILLED IN THOSE
YEARS WERE IN FACT KILLED BY AN INTIMATE. AND SPOUSAL KILLING IS A CRIME
THAT AFFECTS WOMEN. 75 PERCENT OF ALL SPOUSAL KILLINGS IN THAT TIME,
THREE-QUARTERS OF THEM, THE WOMAN WAS THE VICTIM. IN FACT, WHEN LOOKING
AT ALL HOMICIDES, AT ALL -- BOTH MALE AND FEMALE HOMICIDES AS VICTIMS
WHEN I'M SAYING THAT -- OF ALL MEN THAT WERE KILLED IN THAT TIME, EIGHT
PERCENT OF THE MEN WERE KILLED BY THEIR SPOUSES. YET, 50 PERCENT OF
WOMEN THAT WERE KILLED WERE KILLED BY SPOUSES. THAT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT
OTHERS, BUT ACTUALLY BY SPOUSES. 64 PERCENT OF THE WOMEN WHO WERE
VICTIMS OF INTIMATE HOMICIDE WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 39. SOME OF
THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAME OUT BEAR STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE CASE
WE HAVE HERE. JUST WHAT MAKES IT SUCH A TYPICAL SPOUSAL KILLING? COUNSEL
HAD ASKED FOR WHAT THOSE SIMILARITIES ARE. IN THE CASES STUDIED, 90
PERCENT OF THE WOMEN HAVE REPORTED PRIOR ACTS OF ABUSE BY THE OFFENDER.
IN 83 PERCENT OF THE CASES, THE OFFENDER HAD MADE THREATS TO THE VICTIM.
IN 65 PERCENT OF THOSE CASES, THERE HAD BEEN PRIOR POLICE INVOLVEMENT IN
THOSE CASES, JUST LIKE IN THIS CASE. IN THOSE CASES -- WHEN IT WAS
STUDIED, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS LOOKED AT THAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY
WAS MOTIVE. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SPOUSAL KILLING, ONE MOTIVE DOES STAND
CLEAR; AND THAT IS ESTRANGEMENT. ESTRANGEMENT. CONTROL IS AT THE HEART
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE BEHAVIOR AND ABUSES THAT A BATTERER PUTS FORTH
ON HIS VICTIM AND WHEN -- HERE'S WHERE WE TALK ABOUT SIMILARITIES OF ONE
DESIGN AND ONE INTENT. THEY ARE MECHANISMS OF CONTROL. THEY ARE
MECHANISMS TO KEEP THIS WOMAN WITHIN HIS POWER. AND THAT IS ONE OF THE
REASONS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THESE DIFFERENT ACTS IN
RELATIONSHIP TO ONE ANOTHER. IN 45 PERCENT OF THE CASES WHICH WERE
REPORTED, ALMOST HALF, ONE MOTIVE EXISTED; AND THAT WAS ESTRANGEMENT.
THE SECOND LEADING MOTIVE, WHICH IS AN ADDITIONAL 15 PERCENT OF THE
CASES, WAS THE OFFENDER SUSPICION, THAT SOME OTHER MAN WAS INVOLVED WITH
THE WOMAN. THE NOTION OF JEALOUSY AND ESTRANGEMENT ARE TWO THINGS THAT
ARE VERY, VERY STRONG HERE, THAT REOCCUR HERE, THAT WERE DYNAMICS IN
PART OF THIS RELATIONSHIP EVEN BEFORE THESE TWO PEOPLE WERE MARRIED
UNTIL THE DAY THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON DIED. MOST OF THE OFFENDERS
STUDIED HERE ATTACKED THEIR VICTIMS IN CLOSE PHYSICAL CONTACT. IN ALMOST
60 PERCENT OF THE CASES, THE OFFENDER STABBED, BLUDGEONED, STRANGLED,
STABBED OR SLASHED THE THROATS OF THEIR VICTIMS. AND OF THIS FACIAL
ASSAULT INVOLVEMENT THEME OR EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE, MOST ARE GRUESOME CRIME
SCENES, A LOT OF VIOLENCE. IN FACT, IT WAS NOTED THAT MANY OF THE
KILLINGS, THE OFFENDERS INFLICTED HARM WAY BEYOND NECESSARY TO KILL THE
VICTIM. AND THIS IS A QUOTE FROM THE REPORT. FOR EXAMPLE, MORE THAN HALF
THE STABBINGS INVOLVED MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS; IN MANY CASES, DOZENS OF
WOUNDS OVER THE ENTIRE BODY. IN FACT, IT WAS NOTED IN THE REPORT THAT
MANY OF THE POLICE OFFICERS AND CORONERS THAT HAVE WORKED WITH THE CASES
AND DONE THE AUTOPSIES COMMENTED THAT THESE WERE SOME OF THE MOST
GRUESOME CRIME SCENES THEY HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED. 18 PERCENT OF THESE
SPOUSAL KILLINGS OCCURRED AT OR NEAR THE VICTIM'S HOME. THIS REPORT
FOUND THAT WOMEN THAT ARE ESTRANGED, RECENTLY ESTRANGED FROM THEIR
SPOUSES, SPOUSES IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO
BE KILLED BY INTIMATE PARTNERS THAN ANY OTHER REASON. IN FACT, THE
REPORT WENT ON TO PROFILE A CERTAIN SET OF WOMEN, CERTAIN POPULATION OF
WOMEN THAT ARE MOST AT RISK FOR SPOUSAL KILLING. SOME OF THE FACTORS
THEY IDENTIFIED WERE WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN RECENTLY ESTRANGED OR SEPARATED
FROM THEIR PARTNERS, AGE, BETWEEN 30 TO 44, WHO HAD NOT WORKED OUT OF
HOME IN RECENT YEARS AND CENTERED THE MAJORITY OF THEIR LIFE WITHIN
THEIR HOME. NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY THAT MS. BODIN
WILL TALK ABOUT ECHOED HER FEARS, ECHOED THE FEARS THAT SHE WOULD BE
KILLED BY THE DEFENDANT. IN FACT, SHE CHRONICLED HER ABUSE AND LEFT A
TRAIL. IT SHOULD NOT BE AN ECHO THAT SHOULD BE IGNORED. DEFENSE WANTS
OTHER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPOUSAL ABUSE AND KILLING. IN 1993, THE NEW
ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE ARTICLE BY DR. KELLERMAN SAID THAT THE DATA
THAT WAS STUDIED THERE STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT THE RISK OF HOMICIDE IS
MARKEDLY INCREASED IN HOMES WHERE A PERSON HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN HIT OR
HURT IN A FAMILY FIGHT. IN FACT, IT WENT ON TO ADVISE PUBLIC AGENCIES
THAT EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVENTION IS HOMICIDE PREVENTION. IN
THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS WE'LL BE TALKING TODAY -- TALKING ABOUT TODAY, THE
DEFENSE HAS ARGUED THAT TO ALLOW THIS EVIDENCE IN WOULD BE CARVING OUT
SOME SPECIAL RULE. THIS IS NOT THE FACT. THE FACT IS THAT THE LAW SAYS
THAT EVIDENCE WITHIN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE CASES, THIS NOTION OF
TRANSACTIONAL EVIDENCE DOES IN FACT COME IN. MR. GOLDBERG WILL DISCUSS
PRESENT LAW NOT ONLY RELATING TO STALKING, BUT CASES THAT GO BACK TO
1909 AND A LONG LINE OF CASES THAT STAND FOR THIS CRIME. IF ANY SPECIAL
RULE WILL BE CARVED OUT TODAY, THAT WILL BE A RULE WHICH WOULD BE TO
EXCLUDE THIS EVIDENCE, A RULE WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE THE EVIDENCE OF THE
PATTERN OF ABUSE SUFFERED BY THIS VICTIM, A RULE WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE THE
POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN VOICED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THIS STATE AND
STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS THAT
ISSUES WITH REGARD TO BATTERED WOMEN, WITH REGARD TO SPOUSAL ABUSE
SHOULD COME INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY. IN OUR ARGUMENT TODAY, WE BROKE UP --
AND FOR THE COURT'S INFORMATION, MS. BODIN WILL GO THROUGH AND PRESENT
THE FACTS AS WE PERCEIVE THE FACTS HERE, EXPLAIN HOW THEY FIT INTO A
PATTERN, DESCRIBE THE FACTS OF THIS CASE FOR THE COURT. SHE WILL ALSO
ADDRESS HEARSAY OBJECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. THE COURT HAD SOME
QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF ABUSE, AND
I WILL BE RESPONDING TO THAT SHORTLY. MR. UELMEN ARGUED THAT ABUSE MEANS
ONLY PHYSICAL VIOLENCE WITHIN THE NOTION OF FAMILY CODE SECTION 6203.
AGAIN, THIS IS WHERE IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT WHERE THESE TERMS COME
FROM AND WHAT THEY ARE BEING USED FOR. THE TERM "ABUSE" WITHIN DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE IS USED FOR A VARIETY OF CONTROLLED MECHANISMS AND BEHAVIORS.
THE KIND OF ABUSE WHICH CONSTITUTES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS INTIMIDATION,
VERBAL ABUSE AS IN CONTROLLING A PERSON. WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT VERBAL
ABUSE, AND IT WAS JUST AN ARGUMENT OF THE KIND OF MITIGATING FACTS. THE
KIND OF VERBAL ABUSE AND INTIMIDATION THAT WE SEE WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
CASES IS BELITTLING THE VICTIM, CALLING HER NAMES, RUNNING HER DOWN. THE
INCIDENTS THAT WE WILL BE HEARING ABOUT IN THIS CASE, TELLING HER SHE IS
A BIG FAT PIG IN PUBLIC, GRABBING HER CROTCH, SAYING, "THIS IS MINE.
THIS IS WHERE MY CHILDREN COME FROM," THAT IS HUMILIATION, THAT IS
CONTROL MECHANISMS, THAT IS VERBAL ABUSE, USING EMOTIONAL ABUSE.
"EMOTIONAL ABUSE" IS A TERM THAT IS RECOGNIZED IN THE LITERATURE THAT
STARTED WITH LENORE WALKER AND HAS GONE THROUGH THE MAINSTREAM OF THE
LITERATURE, EMOTIONAL ABUSE BEING CONTROL OF THE WOMAN THROUGH PUTTING
HER DOWN, TELLING HER SHE'S CRAZY, MITIGATING WHAT OCCURS WITHIN THE
HOME, INCONSISTENT BEHAVIORS, THE KIND OF EXPLOSIVE RAGE WITH NO
PATTERN. THAT'S EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND IT'S PART OF THE CONTROL CYCLE.
ISOLATION; CUTTING A WOMAN OFF FROM HER SUPPORT SYSTEMS, SUPPORT SYSTEMS
THAT ANYONE NEEDS WITHIN THE WORLD, LIMITING HER FRIENDS WHO SHE CAN
SEE, WHO SHE CAN TALK TO, WHAT CLOTHES SHE CAN WEAR, CAN SHE WORK OUT OF
THE HOME, JUST THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WERE DONE IN THIS CASE.
MINIMIZING -- DENYING, MINIMIZING THE VIOLENCE, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT
HAS BEEN CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS CASE. IT IS SOMETHING
WHICH IS CLASSIC WITHIN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP, FOR THE BATTERER TO
MINIMIZE WHAT HAS OCCURRED. "IT'S JUST A FAMILY PROBLEM. IT WAS NO BIG
THING. WE WERE JUST ARGUING. WE WERE WRESTLING. WE HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK
AND IT JUST KIND OF GOT OUT OF HAND," SAME KIND OF ARGUMENTS WE HEARD TO
-- EXACTLY THE KIND OF BEHAVIORS THAT A BATTERER EXISTS. USING CHILDREN,
THREATENING TO TAKE AWAY CHILDREN, THREATENING TO SOMEHOW AFFECT IN --
ESPECIALLY IN DIVORCE, CUSTODIAL RIGHTS, THREATENING TO AFFECT A WOMAN'S
FINANCIAL STATE OF WELL-BEING SO SHE CAN'T SUPPORT HER KIDS OR TAKE CARE
OF THEM, WRITING HER A LETTER TELLING HER SHE'S GOING TO GO TO JAIL AND
TAKE OUT -- TAKE AWAY ALL THE MONEY THAT SHE HAS, TAKE AWAY HER ABILITY
TO SUPPORT HER CHILDREN. USING MALE PRIVILEGE; IT IS MAKING ALL THE
DECISIONS, NOT GIVING HER A ROLE WITHIN THE RELATIONSHIP, BEING THE
MASTER OF THE CASTLE, THE CENTER OF ATTENTION, THE PERSON THAT WHENEVER
ANYONE GOES -- WHEREVER YOU GO, THE ATTENTION HAS TO CENTER AROUND THE
BATTERER, JUST AS IN THIS CASE. ECONOMIC ABUSE, USING MONEY AS A
CONTROLLING MECHANISM, DECIDING HOW MUCH MONEY SHE COULD HAVE, MAKING
SURE SHE DOESN'T WORK, THREATENING TO TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM HER THAT SHE
MIGHT HAVE AND USING COERCION AND THREATS, PHYSICAL THREATS, "I'M GOING
TO HURT YOU, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU, I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU." THOSE ARE
ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ABUSE, DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONDUCT, DIFFERENT
TYPES OF CONDUCT THAT WE SEE IN THIS CASE. THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE SIMILAR
AND THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE LINKED. AND HOW THEY ARE SIMILAR AND LINKED IS
BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL BEHAVIORS OF CONTROL, THEY ARE ALL BEHAVIORS OF
POWER. AND IMPRINTED ON TOP OF ALL THESE IS "PHYSICAL VIOLENCE." AND
LATER IN THE PRESENTATION, WHEN I'M DISCUSSING BATTERED WOMAN'S
SYNDROME, I WILL EXPLAIN THIS MORE WITH REGARD TO WHAT THAT COMMONLY
MEANS IS POWER AND CONTROL, WHICH WILL EXPLAIN THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF
THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ABUSES. MR. GOLDBERG WILL THEN ADDRESS THE
APPROPRIATENESS OF THIS EVIDENCE UNDER CERTAIN THEORIES OF
ADMISSIBILITY, THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS, TALK ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONAL
ANALYSIS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, WHY THIS LEGALLY -- THIS NOTION, SUPPORT
OF THIS EVIDENCE COMING IN AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION OF THIS HOMICIDE.
HOWEVER, IT ALSO COMES IN UNDER TRADITIONALLY 1101(B). WE WILL ADDRESS
DUE PROCESS CONCERNS THAT WERE ADDRESSED IN OUR BRIEF, BUT NOT ADDRESSED
TODAY IN ARGUMENTS AND DEAL WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES UNDER 352. WE'LL
THEN ADDRESS THE COURT THEN WITH USE OF EXPERT TESTIMONY IN CASES OF
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SPECIFICALLY 1107 OF THE EVIDENCE CODE. AND JUST A
FOOTNOTE ON THAT. I WILL GET INTO MORE DETAIL. IT MUST BE KEPT IN MIND,
1107 IS NOT A STATUTE WHICH WAS INTENDED TO BE AN EXCLUSIONARY DEVICE.
IT WAS A STATUTE WHICH BECAME THE GENESIS, THE SEED. ITS DEVELOPMENT WAS
A STATUTE WHICH WOULD BRING THIS EVIDENCE BEFORE THE LIGHT OF DAY. 1107
STARTED FROM CASES IN WHICH A WOMAN HAD KILLED HER BATTERER, AND THE
DEFENDANT SOUGHT TO BRING THIS EVIDENCE IN TO EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT. AS
MR. UELMEN SAID, IT BASICALLY AROSE AROUND THE TIME ARIS WAS DECIDED.
NOW, WE WILL TALK ABOUT ARIS BECAUSE I ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH HIS
INTERPRETATION A BIT. AND I CERTAINLY WILL ADDRESS THAT, BUT THIS RULE
AROSE AS A RESULT OF INCLUSION. LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF
THIS STATUTE -- MISS BODIN WILL ADDRESS THAT. SHE WAS PART OF THAT
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, WAS PRESENT FOR EVERY HEARING ON IT, IN FACT WROTE
SEVERAL OF THE ADDENDUMS TO THAT STATUTE, WAS ACTUALLY PART OF IT. WHAT
WAS CLEAR FROM THAT LEGISLATURE INTENT WAS THAT THIS WAS A STATUTE OF
INCLUSION. IT SPECIFICALLY IS STATED WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF
THAT STATUTE, WITHIN THE AUTHOR'S INTENT THAT HE DID NOT INTEND TO
ABROGATE ANY STANDING CASE LAW OR OTHER STATUTORY DECISION WITH REGARD
TO THE INCLUSION OF BATTERED WOMAN'S SYNDROME EVIDENCE. SO THE NOTION
THAT 1107 SOMEHOW NARROWS WHAT OTHER CASE LAW WE HAVE OUT THERE, THAT IS
NOT BEHIND THAT STATUTE. IF THERE WERE OTHER METHODS WITHIN WHICH TO
INTRODUCE THIS EVIDENCE BEYOND 1107, THEY STAND. BUT THE PROHIBITION IN
1107 IS LINKED DIRECTLY TO BLEDSOE AND BALKER AND THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT
WHICH PROVIDES THE COURT WITH AN ANALOGOUS, JUST LIMITED TO BLEDSOE AND
BALKER, THAT PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN TYPE OF EVIDENCE IS LIMITED TO ONE
THING. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF EXCLUSION THAT THERE IS IN BLEDSOE WITH
RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME OR BALKER AND CHILD ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME WHERE
WHAT I AM PROHIBITED FROM DOING AS A PROSECUTOR IS TO ASK A DOCTOR,
"HAVE YOU EXAMINED THE VICTIM; AND IF YOU HAVE, DO YOU THINK SHE WAS
RAPED?" I CAN'T -- WE DON'T INTEND TO DO THAT, USE THE EVIDENCE THAT
TYPE OF WAY. THAT IS THE LIMITATION THAT IS PLACED ON BATTERED WOMAN'S
SYNDROME UNDER 1107. TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S GREATER THAN THAT, TO SUGGEST
THAT IT GOES FARTHER THAN THAT IS NOT WITHIN THE CASE LAW OR THE
STATUTES OR THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT. AS THIS CASE HAS PROGRESSED, WE HAVE
DEALT WITH A LOT OF BRAND NEW ISSUES IN THE LAW, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD
TO PRESENTING EVIDENCE, ISSUES WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC ACCESS TO TRIALS.
IN FACT, IN MANY WAYS, WHAT IS OCCURRING WITHIN THIS TRIAL AND THE WAY
THAT THIS TRIAL IS BEING PRESENTED PERCEIVED BY THE PUBLIC WILL TAKE US
INTO PROBABLY THE 21ST CENTURY AS TO WHAT WILL OCCUR IN TRIAL, AND WE'RE
SETTING THE PRECEDENCE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING CERTAINLY TO BE APPLAUDED.
AS WE DO THAT, WE CERTAINLY CANNOT DO THAT WITH 19TH CENTURY
SENSIBILITIES. WOMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THEIR
ABUSE HAS BEEN KEPT IN THE SHADOWS. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WHAT OCCURS TO
A WOMAN, ONE OF THE DYNAMICS OF THAT ENTIRE STRUGGLE IS ONE OF SECRECY,
SHADOWS AND VEIL. IT CERTAINLY HAS TO BE BROUGHT OUT INTO THE LIGHT AT
SOME POINT. AND WHEN WE HAVE A STATE OF THE LAW WHERE THE STATE OF THE
LAW IS, THAT IS SO CLEAR THAT WHEN A WOMEN HAS KILLED HER BATTERER, THAT
THAT EVIDENCE MUST COME IN, IT'S REVERSIBLE EVIDENCE ERROR FOR IT NOT TO
COME IN, THEN CERTAINLY IF THAT GROUP OF WOMEN NEED TO BE PROTECTED BY
THAT EVIDENCE COMING IN, AS IT WELL SHOULD, THEN WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN
KILLED BY THEIR BATTERERS CERTAINLY NEED TO HAVE THE COURT OR THE TRIER
OF FACT LISTEN TO THAT EVIDENCE TO MAKE THE PROPER JUDGMENT. PEOPLE
VERSUS DAY, VERY RECENT CASE WHICH INTERPRETED 1107, THE COURT
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED THAT WHEN IT SAID THAT -- I GOT A CITE FOR THE
COURT -- 2 CAL. APP. 4 409 -- WHERE IT TALKED ABOUT THE TRIER OF FACT,
IN MANY CASES, HAS THE JUROR SITTING THERE, HAVE NEVER BEEN RAPED, HAVE
NOT LIVED WITHIN A BATTERER -- AS A BATTERED PERSON, HAVE NO PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE WITH CHILD ABUSE. AND FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OCCURS IN
THAT CASE, THEY NEED TO HEAR EXPERT TESTIMONY WHICH EXPLAINS IT. IN
FACT, THE COURT GOES ON TO SAY IN THAT CASE THAT:

"DEPRIVING THE FINDER OF FACT OF SUCH UNDERSTANDING MAY WELL LEAD TO A
CONCLUSION BASED ON MISCONCEPTIONS UPHELD IN GOOD FAITH, THAT SUCH
CONCEPTIONS ARE HELD IN GOOD FAITH AND NO WAY LESSENS THE MAGNITUDE OF
THE ERROR AND THE INJUSTICE THAT WILL RESULT." WHAT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED
FROM THIS ARGUMENT IS THAT UNDER THE FACTS THAT WE HAVE HERE, THE LEGAL
ANALYSIS AND THE POLICY AND LEGAL ANALYSIS WITH REGARD TO EXPERT
TESTIMONY, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR THAT THE HISTORY OF ABUSE, THE PATTERN
OF ABUSE SUFFERED BY THE VICTIM, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, IN THIS CASE MUST
COME INTO THIS TRIAL. THERE WAS A MOTIVE FOR THIS KILLING, AND THIS
MOTIVE WAS THE SAME MOTIVE WHICH IS PRESENT IN THE MAJORITY OF SPOUSAL,
WIFE KILLINGS; AND THAT IS ONE OF ESTRANGEMENT AND JEALOUSY. THAT IS
CLEARLY WHAT THE MOTIVE IS IN THIS CASE. WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT TEXTBOOK
TYPES OF CASES, DRUG CASES, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES. THAT IS A TEXTBOOK
MOTIVE, AND WE HAVE A DUTY AS PROSECUTORS TO PROVE MOTIVE. THE EVIDENCE
THAT WE DESCRIBED HERE TODAY PROVES THAT. WE HAVE A DUTY AS PROSECUTORS
TO PROVE INTENT. WE WILL PROVE INTENT; AND THE INTENT THAT WE WILL PROVE
IS THE INTENT TO CONTROL, THE INTENT THAT WAS PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE
COURSE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP, THE CONTROL THAT STARTED ON A FAIRLY LOW
LEVEL, THAT STARTED WITH DECIDING WHO SHE COULD SEE, WHAT SHE COULD
WEAR, WHERE SHE COULD GO, CONTROL THAT ESCALATED WITH PUBLIC
HUMILIATION, PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, PROPERTY DESTRUCTION, VERY SPECIFIC
PROPERTY DESTRUCTION, WHICH IS CALLED SYMBOLIC VIOLENCE, DESTROYING THE
PICTURES OF HER FAMILY, POSSESSIONS THAT WERE VERY CLOSE TO HER. IT
ESCALATES. AT ONE POINT, SHE ATTEMPTED TO GET AWAY. AND WHEN SHE DID,
SHE FINALLY DID SOMETHING WHICH MARKED IN THIS DEFENDANT'S MIND THAT THE
RELATIONSHIP WAS OVER. AND IT'S VERY COMMON IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS THAT
THE DEFENDANT IS OF THE MIND SET THAT, "I CONTROL THIS WOMAN. SHE IS
MINE. I HAVE TO HAVE HER. SHE IS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE WORLD FOR ME. I
CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER. IF I CAN'T HAVE HER, NO ONE WILL." THOSE ARE
STATEMENTS WHICH ARE CLASSIC IN THESE TYPES OF CASES. THEY ARE
STATEMENTS THAT ARE HERE. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT MESSAGE FINALLY
GETS CLEAR -- THROUGH TO THE BATTERER, THAT HE CAN'T HAVE HER ANYMORE,
THAT SHE IS FINALLY GOING TO ESCAPE THIS CYCLE, SHE'S FINALLY BUILT UP
THE COURAGE TO GO, THAT THE CONTROL DOESN'T -- THE ACTS OF CONTROL THAT
HAVE BEEN GOING ON AND ESCALATING DON'T WORK ANYMORE. THERE HAS TO BE
ANOTHER CONTROL MECHANISM THAT COMES INTO PLACE, BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T
HAVE HER, NO ONE WILL. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE ESTRANGEMENT, THE
JEALOUSY COMES UP, WELLS UP WITHIN HIM AND THERE HAS TO BE A MECHANISM,
CONTROL EMPLOYED. AND THAT LAST AND TERMINAL MECHANISM OF CONTROL, THAT
WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BATTERER CAN HAVE HER AND NO ONE ELSE WILL IS
TO KILL HER. THAT IS CLEAR IN THE RESEARCH. IT IS CLEAR IN THE SCIENCES
THAT WORK WITH BATTERERS. IT IS CLEAR IN THE SOCIAL POLICY. IT IS WHY
SOME OF THE LEGISLATORS HAVE ENACTED STRONG STATUTES TO INTERVENE
BATTERING IN A VERY LOW END TO PREVENT HOMICIDES. IT IS CLEAR FROM THE
FACTS OF THIS CASE. YOUR HONOR, EVERY YEAR, AS WE HAVE HEARD, THERE ARE
AT LEAST 2.5 MILLION WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT ARE AFFECTED BY
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS RECENTLY
REPORTED THAT ABOUT 35 -- BETWEEN 22 PERCENT AND 35 PERCENT OF THE WOMEN
VISITING EMERGENCY ROOMS EVERY YEAR ARE DOING SO BECAUSE OF AN INSTANT
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MANY OF THESE WOMEN ARE INJURED AND KILLED BECAUSE
THEIR VIOLENCE STAYS SECRET. THE VIOLENCE THAT OCCURS TO THEM STAYS IN
THE SHADOW. NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS ONE OF THESE WOMEN. AND UP UNTIL
TODAY, UP UNTIL THIS TRIAL, HER ABUSE HAS BEEN HIDDEN TOO JUST LIKE IT
IS WITH SO MANY OTHER WOMEN. NOW, AT LEAST AT THAT POINT WHERE HER
BATTERER IS ON TRIAL FOR KILLING HER, THAT EVIDENCE WHICH EXPLAINS HER
LIFE, EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENED TO HER AND EXPLAINS WHY SHE WAS KILLED GOES
TO THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE'S CASE, GOES TO THE HEART OF WHAT OCCURRED IN
THIS RELATIONSHIP AND IS THE TRUTH. AND AS ZACK SAYS, THE PROCESS OF A
TRIAL IS TO SEEK THE TRUTH, NOT PART OF IT, BUT ALL OF IT.

*THE COURT:* MS. BODIN.

*MS. BODIN:* YOUR HONOR, I'M GOING TO MAKE A FACTUAL PRESENTATION WITH
REGARD TO THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE. I APPRECIATE THE COURT GIVING US A LIST
OF ACTS. IT IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND BASICALLY COMPORTED WHAT WE HAD
ALREADY SET UP FOR OURSELVES, AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO ANSWER THAT.
SPECIFICALLY, THE COURT HAD ASKED US TO ADDRESS LEGAL THEORIES. AS I GO
THROUGH MY ARGUMENT AND TALK ABOUT THE FACTS THAT ARE SPOKEN OF IN OUR
BRIEF AND OF COURSE THE NEW ACTS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN OUR
ADDENDUM, I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE LEGAL THEORIES THAT UNDER PIN --
UNDER PIN, THE ADMISSION OF THESE ACTS. THE STATEMENT OF FACTS THAT I'M
GOING TO MAKE TO THE COURT TODAY STARTS IN 1977 UNTIL THE TIME OF THE
MURDER OF THE VICTIM BY THE DEFENDANT. THE ACTS OF ABUSE THAT WE ARE
GOING TO TALK ABOUT WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: OBSESSIVE AND JEALOUS
BEHAVIOR, PUBLIC HUMILIATION OF THE VICTIM, FINANCIAL MANIPULATION,
THREATS OF VIOLENCE, ACTUAL PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, STALKING AND FINALLY THE
MURDER ITSELF. THERE IS AN IMPRESSIVE BODY OF LITERATURE AND RESEARCH
THAT HAS LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND IN LAW, THERE
IS EQUALLY AN IMPRESSIVE BODY OF LAW THAT LOOKS AT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
THE TYPES OF ACTS THAT I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED TO THE COURT ARE ACTS THAT
HAVE BEEN WELL ADDRESSED IN THE CASE LAW. WITH REGARD TO PROPERTY
DESTRUCTION -- AND THESE ARE CITED IN OUR BRIEF -- THERE ARE TWO CASES,
HELFEN AND HAYLOCK. AND THOSE CASES TALK ABOUT PROPERTY DESTRUCTION.
BOTH OF THEM TALK ABOUT ARSON. AND WHAT THE COURT SAID IN BOTH OF THOSE
CASES IS THAT PROPERTY DESTRUCTION GOES TO MOTIVE. PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS
DISCUSSED IN ZACK. THERE'S LOTS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IN THE FACT PATTERN
THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT AND SPECIFICALLY THAT GOES TO IDENTITY A
PERMISSIBLE 1101(B) PURPOSE, AS IS MOTIVE. STALKING, IT'S TALKED ABOUT
IN THE NICHOLAS CASE. AND PARTICULARLY STALKING AND STARING WHICH WE SEE
IN THIS CASE, AND IN THE NICHOLAS CASE, THE COURT SAYS THAT GOES TO
PREMEDITATION, WHICH WE HAVE TO PROVE IN THIS CASE. POSSESSIVENESS AND
JEALOUSY GOES TO MOTIVE. AND THERE ARE THREE CASES CITED IN OUR BRIEF
THAT TALK ABOUT THAT IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONTEXT. THOSE THREE CASES
ARE THE DUMAS CASE, WHERE THE DEFENDANT STATED, "IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU,
NOBODY ELSE CAN." THAT UNFORTUNATELY BECOMES AN ECHO IN THIS CASE. THE
SHAVER CASE, WHERE THE DEFENDANT ACCUSED THE VICTIM AND ULTIMATELY
MURDERED HER -- ACCUSED HER OF BEING WITH OTHER MEN AND ULTIMATELY
KILLED HER BECAUSE OF IT. AND THE DANIELS CASE, WHICH TALKS ABOUT
JEALOUSY, QUARRELS AND ENMITY, WHICH AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY IS A VERY
FAMILIAR THEME IN THE FACT PATTERN I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE TO THIS COURT.
AND FINALLY, FINANCIAL MANIPULATION. AND THAT IS DISCUSSED IN THE
ARGENTOS CASE, WHICH IS NOT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE, BUT TALKS ABOUT
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO GOLD MINERS. RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE IS NOT
LIMITED MERELY TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THE CASE LAW IN CALIFORNIA
BEGINNING IN THE EARLY 1920'S IS REPLETE WITH CASES INVOLVING
RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE. WE'VE CITED THEM IN OUR BRIEF AND I'VE CITED SOME
OF THEM TO THE COURT. NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON MET THE DEFENDANT IN 1977.
THE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP BEGAN EARLY. IN FACT, IT
BEGAN IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IN 1977 OR 1978, THERE
WAS A VERY LOUD ARGUMENT OVERHEARD BY THEIR NEIGHBORS ON ASHTON STREET.
THE NEIGHBORS WERE CONNIE AND STEVEN GOOD. THE PEOPLE HAVE CONDUCTED AN
INTERVIEW WITH MS. GOOD. MS. GOOD STATES THAT SHE REMEMBERS THE INCIDENT
VERY WELL. AND WHAT SHE REMEMBERS IS THIS: SHE COULD HEAR ARGUING. SHE
COULD HEAR THE DEFENDANT YELLING AND CALLING THE VICTIM NAMES.
SPECIFICALLY, HE CALLED HER A FUCKING BITCH AND A MOTHER FUCKER. SHE
KNEW THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE. SHE HAD HEARD IT BEFORE AROUND THE
APARTMENT. SHE HAD HEARD IT IN AN ELEVATOR AND THAT IT HAD A UNIQUE
SOUND. SHE HEARD THUMPING AND THE VOICE OF A FEMALE CRYING. A DAY OR TWO
LATER, SHE SAW THE VICTIM AND THE DEFENDANT IN AN ELEVATOR, AND THE
VICTIM HAD TWO BLACK EYES. MR. UELMEN HAS ARGUED THAT BECAUSE THIS
HAPPENED SO LONG AGO, THAT THIS IS ATTENUATED, THAT IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER. THERE IS A THEME OF PHYSICAL
VIOLENCE. AND I'LL KEEP ON TALKING ABOUT THIS AS I GO THROUGH THE
STATEMENT OF FACTS, THAT WE HAVE STEALTH THROUGH THIS STATEMENT OF FACTS
AND THROUGH THE LIFE OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON THAT IS CONSISTENT, THAT IS
VICIOUS, THAT ESCALATED TO OTHER FORMS OF ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR AND IT IS BUT
THE PRELUDE TO WHAT ULTIMATELY WAS A HOMICIDE. IT SHOWS THE START OF A
LONG HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THERE ARE DIARY ENTRIES THAT MR.
UELMEN HAS ALLUDED TO IN HIS ARGUMENT. SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS A DIARY
ENTRY WITH REGARD TO A TIME IN 1977 WHERE THE DEFENDANT SLAMMED THE
VICTIM INTO A WALL. AND THERE WAS A WITNESS TO THAT, AND THAT WITNESS
WAS AL COWLINGS. NEXT, THERE IS AN ENTRY IN THAT DOCUMENT, THAT DIARY,
WITH REGARD TO A TRIP TO NEW YORK WHERE THE DEFENDANT PUBLICLY SLAPPED
HER AND CALLED HER MOTHER A WHORE, AND SHE HAD CALLED FOR HELP ON THE
STREET. THERE IS AN INCIDENT IN 1982 WHERE THE VICTIM WENT TO A FRIEND
OF THE DEFENDANT'S BY THE NAME OF WAYNE HUGHES. MR. UELMEN HAS STATED
THAT IS RANK HEARSAY. WE HAVE A WITNESS. THEY HAVE COPIES OF OUR
INTERVIEW WITH THAT WITNESS, THAT IS MR. WAYNE HUGHES, WITH REGARD TO
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON COMING TO HIS HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH
A RED SPOT BEGGING HIM TO TALK TO THE DEFENDANT ABOUT THE DEFENDANT'S
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TOWARDS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. SHE WAS EXTREMELY UPSET
AND BORE THE MARKS OF VIOLENCE. IN 1978, THERE WAS AN INCIDENT THAT IS
RECORDED IN THE DIARY WITH REGARD TO THE DEFENDANT HITTING HER IN THE
WINE CELLAR AND LOCKING HER IN THERE. THERE WAS ALSO, IN THAT SAME
DOCUMENT, A NOTATION WITH REGARD TO A SAN JOSE TRACK MEET WHERE HE
BACKHANDED HER IN THE CAR AND THEN LEFT HER ON A ROADSIDE. AND FINALLY
IN THAT DOCUMENT, THERE IS A MENTION OF A HIT THAT SHE TOOK, A BEATING
THAT SHE TOOK BECAUSE THE DEFENDANT FOUND A NOTE THAT SHE WROTE TO
HERSELF. NOW, MR. UELMEN HAS DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM -- HEARSAY PROBLEM OF
GETTING IN DIARY ENTRIES. AND THAT'S WELL TAKEN. BUT I THINK THE DEFENSE
SHOULD BE ON NOTICE THAT WE CERTAINLY ARE GOING TO CROSS-EXAMINE
WITNESSES WHO THE DEFENSE PRESENT, PERHAPS THE DEFENDANT HIMSELF, WITH
REGARD TO THESE INCIDENTS. WE PUT THEM IN TO SHOW THE COURT WHAT WE
HAVE. FURTHERMORE, WE ARE HAVING OBVIOUSLY AN EXPERT LOOK AT THIS CASE
AND WE ARE HAVING THE EXPERT USE THOSE INCIDENTS, THOSE DIARY INCIDENTS
AS PART OF THE FOUNDATION FOR THE OPINION THAT THE EXPERT WILL FORM IN
THIS CASE. FINALLY -- AND THE COURT KNOWS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF
DISCUSSION ABOUT DISCOVERY IN THIS CASE, AND WE HAVE AN ON-GOING
INVESTIGATION. IT HAS BEEN THE CASE WHERE WE HAVE HAD DIARY ENTRIES THAT
HAVE FINALLY BEEN CORROBORATED BY KNOWN WITNESSES. AND THAT'S OCCURRED A
NUMBER OF TIMES IN THIS CASE. AND SO WE DID INCLUDE THEM IN OUR
STATEMENT OF FACTS AND WE DID WANT TO PUT EVERYBODY ON NOTICE THAT WE
DID HAVE THEM AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE THEM. IN 1978, THERE
WAS AN INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED AT THE LA CANTINA -- I GUESS -- IT IS A
BAR I THINK AS CHARACTERIZED BY MR. UELMEN. IN 1978, NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON, THE DEFENDANT, DENISE BROWN AND ED MC CABE WENT TO LA CANTINA
WHERE THEY CONTINUED THEIR GET-TOGETHER BACK TO THE ROCKINGHAM ADDRESS.
BACK AT THE ROCKINGHAM ADDRESS, THEY WERE TALKING, HAVING A SOCIAL
OCCASION, DENISE BROWN COMMENTED THAT O.J. TOOK NICOLE FOR GRANTED. IT
WAS A SIMPLE STATEMENT. THE DEFENDANT LITERALLY THREW A FIT. WHAT HE DID
WAS, HE THREW THEM ALL OUT OF THE HOUSE, HE SLAMMED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON
INTO A WALL, HE THREW HER OUT THE DOOR FROM A FOYER ENTRANCE AND HE
BROKE ALL THE FAMILY PICTURES. WE HAVE AN EYEWITNESS TO THIS. IT DOES
SHOW A LONG HISTORY OF QUARRELING AND A PHYSICAL ABUSE AGAIN IN 1978,
WHERE ONCE AGAIN, PICKING UP THE THREAD OF PHYSICAL ABUSE. WE'RE ALSO
PICKING UP THE THREAD NOW OF PROPERTY DAMAGE, DESTROYING FAMILY
PICTURES. IN 1983 TO 1984, WE HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH A WOMAN WHO WORKED
FOR THE SIMPSON'S BY THE NAME OF MARIA BAUR. THERE WAS A STATEMENT TAKEN
FROM HER THAT SHE OBSERVED NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WALKING DOWN THE
DRIVEWAY LITERALLY HOLDING HERSELF AND CRYING. MARIA INQUIRED OF HER,
"WHAT'S WRONG, NICOLE?" AND SHE SAID, "YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED." AND WHEN MARIA WENT INTO THE HOUSE, SHE
FOUND GLASS ALL UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SHE CLEANED IT UP. IN FACT,
THERE IS A CONSISTENT THEME THROUGHOUT THIS FACT PATTERN THAT THE
DEFENDANT LIKES TO DESTROY PHOTOS OF THE VICTIM. HE DESTROYS FAMILY
PHOTOS, A FORM OF HUMILIATION, A FORM OF DEGRADATION, A DESTRUCTION OF
CHERISHED MOMENTOES, THINGS THAT ARE BORNE CLOSE TO THE HEART, THINGS
THAT REALLY MEAN SOMETHING, THINGS THAT PERHAPS COULD BE REPLACED
MONETARILY, BUT THE SENTIMENTAL VALUE IS EXCESSIVE TO A PERSON. BY 1986,
THE VICTIM IS RELATING IN HER DIARY THAT SHE HAD GONE OUT FOR AN EVENING
WITH SOME FRIENDS, GOT IN AN ARGUMENT AND THE DEFENDANT BEAT HER. THERE
IS MEDICAL EVIDENCE FROM THIS INCIDENT FROM DR. MARTIN ALPERT. WHAT THE
VICTIM RELATED WAS THAT SHE HAD HAD A BICYCLE ACCIDENT. THE DOCTOR SAYS
THAT BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE INJURY, THE TYPE OF INJURY THAT SHE
SUSTAINED, IT WAS IMPLAUSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD A BICYCLE
ACCIDENT. WHAT WE KNOW -- AND IF AN EXPERT WILL TESTIFY AND SHOULD
TESTIFY IN A CASE INVOLVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- IS THAT VERY
FREQUENTLY, VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DO NOT REPORT HOW THEY OBTAIN
THEIR INJURY. THEY'RE AFRAID TO DO IT AND THEY'RE PARTICULARLY AFRAID TO
DO IT WHEN THEY'RE ACCOMPANIED FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT BY THEIR BATTERER.
AND THAT IS TRUE IN THIS CASE. SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE DEFENDANT FOR
MEDICAL TREATMENT. ONCE AGAIN, AN INCIDENT OF PHYSICAL ABUSE AND SHOWING
ONCE AGAIN CONTINUOUS CONDUCT INVOLVING PHYSICAL ABUSE. BY 1985 -- AND
IN 1985, WE HAVE AN INCIDENT INVOLVING THE SMASHING OF A WHITE MERCEDEZ
THAT BELONGED TO THE VICTIM. WE HAVE TWO ACCOUNTS OF THIS. MR. UELMEN
STATED THAT THE ONLY ACCOUNT OF THIS IS THROUGH THE MEMORANDUM WRITTEN
BY DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN. THAT IS SIMPLY NOT SO, THAT HE HAS
MISCHARACTERIZED THE FACTS TO THIS COURT. WE HAVE ANOTHER REPORT BY AN
INDIVIDUAL BY THE NAME OF SERGEANT MARK DAY, WHO AT THAT TIME IN 1985
WORKED FOR WESTEC SECURITY, AND HE RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT. HE'S
WRITTEN A REPORT. THE DEFENSE HAS IT. WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS BESIDES
DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN. AND I MIGHT ALSO ADD THAT THERE IS A CHALLENGE
IN THIS HEARING TO THE CREDIBILITY OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN. CREDIBILITY IS
NOT AN ISSUE IN A 402 HEARING. BUT WE DO HAVE WITNESSES ON THIS ISSUE
AND WE HAVE EYEWITNESSES ON THIS ISSUE. ONCE AGAIN, AN EXAMPLE OF
PROPERTY DAMAGE, A DESTRUCTION OF WHAT PROBABLY WAS A STATUS SYMBOL OF A
BELOVED OBJECT TO A BATTERED WOMAN. IN 1988, THERE IS AN -- EXCUSE ME --
THERE IS AN INCIDENT RECANTED IN THE DIARY, AND IT WAS WITNESSED BY
DENISE BROWN, WHEREIN THE DEFENDANT BECAME ANGRY BECAUSE NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON ALLOWED A GAY MAN TO KISS HER CHILD. AND WHAT DENISE SAW WAS
THAT THE DEFENDANT GOT MAD, YELLED AT NICOLE MERELY BECAUSE SHE LET A
STRANGER KISS HER BABY BECAUSE THE MAN THOUGHT THAT HER CHILD WAS CUTE,
AND NICOLE LEFT THE CAR THAT THEY WERE RIDING IN AND HAD TO RIDE BACK TO
THE HOTEL WITH HER PARENTS. DENISE ALSO RELATES THAT DURING THE COURSE
OF THEIR VACATION IN HAWAII, NICOLE WORE A BATHING SUIT COVER-UP. NICOLE
REPORTS IN HER DIARY THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEATEN UP TO THE EXTENT THAT SHE
WAS WEARING THAT COVER-UP. IN 1988, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON RECORDS IN A
THREE-PAGE LETTER THAT SHE HAD SCHEDULED AN OUTING FOR HERSELF AND HER
CHILDREN TO "DISNEY ON ICE". THIS WAS A TIME WHEN SHE WAS TWO MONTHS'
PREGNANT. SHE HAD ASKED THE DEFENDANT IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH HER
AND SHE BELIEVED THAT HE WAS WILLING TO GO. BY THE TIME THAT IT CAME
TIME TO ACTUALLY GO TO "DISNEY ON ICE", HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO. AND SO SHE
JUST SIMPLY TOOK THE CHILDREN AND WENT WITH HER MOTHER AND HER SISTER,
DOMINIQUE, BY HERSELF WITH THE CHILDREN, LEAVING THE DEFENDANT TO DO
WHATEVER HE WAS DOING. WHEN SHE GOT HOME, HE BEGAN TO DENIGRATE HER. HE
BEGAN TO CALL HER A FAT SLOB, TO CALL HER A PIG. WHEN SHE WAS TWO
MONTHS' PREGNANT, HE MADE HER LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH SIDNEY, HER CHILD,
AND TOLD HER OVER THE PHONE THAT HE HAD A GUN. AND WE KNOW OF COURSE
THAT THE DEFENDANT HAS A GUN COLLECTION. THAT OCCURS IN THE FACT
PATTERN. AND THEN AL COWLINGS WAS PRESENT FOR A PART OF IT, THAT HE SORT
OF TOOK CHARGE OF SIDNEY SO THAT NICOLE COULD LEAVE THE ROOM AND THE
DEFENDANT COULD FOLLOW HER OUT, DENIGRATING HER THE WHOLE TIME. THERE IS
AN INCIDENT REPORTED IN 1986 TO 1987 BY AN INDIVIDUAL BY THE NAME OF
ALBERT AGUILARA -- AND THAT OCCURS IN OUR ADDENDUM THAT WE FILED --
WHERE HE SEES NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON GET HIT BY THE DEFENDANT AT VICTORIA
BEACH. IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT THEY WERE SIMPLY PLAYING, NICOLE WAS
TEASING THE DEFENDANT ON THE BEACH, AND THEN HE JUST BASICALLY REACHED
UP AND SLAPPED HER IN THE FACE. ONCE AGAIN OF COURSE, I'M SURE THERE'S
AN ARGUMENT THAT THERE'S ATTENUATION IN TIME. BUT ONCE AGAIN, I WOULD
REITERATE TO THE COURT THAT IT REINFORCES ONCE AGAIN THE PATTERNS OF
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, THE CONSISTENT THEME THAT RUNS THROUGHOUT THIS CASE.
AND THEN WE GET TO 1989, NEW YEAR'S DAY. THERE IS A 911 TAPE THAT THE
PEOPLE HAVE, THE DEFENSE HAS WHEREIN IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE TAPE, YOU
CAN HEAR A WOMAN SCREAMING. THE POLICE REPORT TO THE HOUSE ON
ROCKINGHAM. OFFICER EDWARDS FROM THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT GETS
THERE, AND HE CALLS AND SAYS, YOU KNOW, "WHAT'S GOING ON? WHO'S
SCREAMING? I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE HERE UNTIL I FIND OUT WHO'S
SCREAMING." HE'S TOLD SIMPLY TO GO AWAY PRESUMABLY BY THE HOUSEKEEPER
MICHELLE. AND WHILE HE'S THERE, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON RUNS OUT WEARING
ONLY A PAIR OF SWEAT PANTS AND A BRA. SHE YELLED OUT TO HIM, "HE'S GOING
TO KILL ME." IT WAS CLEAR TO OFFICER EDWARDS THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEATEN
UP. BOTH NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND THE DEFENDANT TELL THE POLICE THAT
THEY HAD BEEN OUT THERE AT LEAST EIGHT TIMES BEFORE. THE DEFENDANT TELLS
THE POLICE THAT THIS WAS A FAMILY MATTER. AND IN FACT, WHAT HE DID WAS,
HE FOLLOWED HER OUT THERE. AFTER THE TIME THAT THE POLICE SAW HER
RUNNING OUT SAYING, "HE'S GOING TO KILL ME," THEN THE DEFENDANT ARRIVES
IN A BATHROBE. AND INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE POLICE, WHAT HE DOES IS, HE
STARTS YELLING AT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, SUCH THAT THE POLICE HAVE TO
GIVE HER A JACKET AND LET HER SIT IN THE POLICE CAR. WE HAVE PICTURES OF
THAT INCIDENT THAT WERE TAKEN BY THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. MR.
UELMEN HAS CHARACTERIZED THIS AS A BEDROOM ARGUMENT, SOME SLAPPING AND
SOME HITTING. ONE PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS, AND I'LL NOW SHOW
THAT PICTURE TO THE COURT.

*THE COURT:* SHOW THOSE TO COUNSEL, PLEASE.

*MS. BODIN:* YES. WE --

(MS. BODIN COMPLIES.)

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THOSE PICTURES BE SHOWN TO YOU, NOT
THE SCREEN.

*MS. BODIN:* FOR PURPOSES OF THIS HEARING, I'M GOING TO MARK THESE SO
THEY WILL BE IDENTIFIED AT SOME LATER TIME SHOULD WE NEED TO HAVE A
RECORD OF THIS.

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MS. BODIN:* THERE ARE ACTUALLY A SERIES OF THREE PHOTOS. THE FIRST
PHOTO THAT I'M LOOKING AT IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, AND
SHE'S WEARING A PAIR OF SWEAT PANTS, AND THEY APPEAR DIRTY ON ONE SIDE.
I AM MARKING THAT AS P-1 AND I'M MARKING THAT IN THE RIGHT-HAND CORNER.
MAY I HAVE JUST A MOMENT TO CONFER WITH MR. DARDEN?

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. BODIN:* YOUR HONOR, I AM GOING TO CONFER -- I'M NOT FINISHED
CONFERRING WITH MR. DARDEN. WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS, I'M GOING TO MARK
IT IN THE UPPER RIGHT-HAND CORNER OF EACH PHOTOGRAPH. WE HAVE SOME WORK
THAT WE NEED TO DO ON THOSE. AND IF I DON'T MARK IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE,
IT'S GOING TO COMPROMISE OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT WORK. SO WITH REGARD TO
P-1, THAT'S THE PHOTOGRAPH OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON STANDING WITH DIRTY
SWEAT PANTS. AND I'M SHOWING THESE TO MR. UELMEN SO HE CAN SEE HOW I'M
MARKING THEM. P-2 IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON PULLING HER
HAIR BACK AND SHOWING HER FACE. AND FINALLY, P-3, WHICH IS ALSO A
PHOTOGRAPH -- IT'S MORE OF A FULL FACIAL PHOTO -- SHE'S PULLING ALL THE
HAIR OFF HER FACE. AND I AM MARKING THAT AS P-3.

(PEO'S 1, 2 AND 3 FOR ID = PHOTOGRAPHS)

*MS. BODIN:* MAY I APPROACH?

*THE COURT:* PLEASE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, MS. BODIN. I'VE HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THESE PHOTOGRAPHS.

*MS. BODIN:* ALL RIGHT, YOUR HONOR. IN ADDITION TO THE PICTURES THAT
I'VE PRESENTED NOW TO THE COURT, THERE ARE ALSO THREE APOLOGY LETTERS
THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED OR THAT HAVE COME INTO OUR POSSESSION. THOSE THREE
APOLOGY LETTERS WERE SEIZED FROM THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FOLLOWING THE
DEATH OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. WE ACTUALLY WILL HAVE THOSE AVAILABLE. WE
HAVE SHOWN THOSE TO COUNSEL IN CHAMBERS. I'VE SENT FOR MY INVESTIGATOR,
AND I'LL LET THE COURT TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE ALSO IN JUST A MOMENT. WE
ALSO HAVE A PRENUPTIAL -- A LETTER REGARDING A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT FROM
THE DEFENDANT BASICALLY STATING THAT IF HE EVER BEAT HER UP AGAIN WITH
REFERENCE TO THIS INCIDENT, THAT THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT WOULD
BASICALLY BE VOIDED. WE HAVE MEDICAL RECORDS. WE ALSO HAVE A SWORN
DEPOSITION WHEREIN THE DEFENDANT ADOPTS HIS LETTER WITH REGARD TO THE
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT. THERE IS ALSO A TAPE OF THE DEFENDANT TALKING
ABOUT THIS INCIDENT ON ESPN, AND HE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH AN OFFICER
FARRELL OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT BASICALLY ADOPTING THE FACT
THAT THIS HAD OCCURRED. NOW, THERE HAS BEEN SOME QUESTION WITH REGARD TO
THE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET IN THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THIS
CASE BY THE VICTIM. AND I MIGHT ADD, WE WOULD LIKE TO GET IN SOME
STATEMENTS BY THE DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE HE COMES OUT -- HE'S
ROARING AT HER WHEN HE COMES OUT THERE. AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS TRANSACTION, AND I WOULD LIKE THE
COURT -- AND WE DO TALK ABOUT IT IN OUR BRIEF -- TO LOOK AT THE CASE OF
PEOPLE VERSUS FARMER. BASICALLY THAT IS A CASE THAT TALKS ABOUT HEARSAY
EXCEPTION AND EXCITED UTTERANCE PURSUANT TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1240.
WHAT THAT CASE STANDS FOR IS THAT THE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS WITH REGARD TO
WHETHER OR NOT THIS TYPE OF HEARSAY STATEMENT IS ADMISSIBLE IS WHETHER
THE MENTAL STATE OF THE SPEAKER IS THAT SUCH THAT THE STATEMENT IS BEING
MADE UNDER THE STRESS THAT WAS PRODUCED BY THE EVENT. WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN
IN OUR BRIEF THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS WASHINGTON. PEOPLE VERSUS
WASHINGTON BASICALLY LAYS OUT THE ELEMENTS OF 1240 AND STATES THAT IT
MUST BE AN OCCURRENCE THAT IS STARTLING ENOUGH TO PRODUCE NERVOUS
EXCITEMENT AND RENDER THE UTTERANCE SPONTANEOUS. THERE MUST BE ACTUAL
NERVOUS EXCITEMENT AND IT MUST DOMINATE AT THE TIME OF THE UTTERANCE,
AND THE UTTERANCE ITSELF MUST BE ABOUT THE STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCE. THE
CASE OF PEOPLE V. HUEY STANDS FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT SUCH STATEMENTS
MAY BE OFFERED TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE FACT AND TO IDENTIFY THE
ASSAILANT. THE INCIDENT THAT THE COURT IS LOOKING AT IS VERY SIMILAR TO
THE HUEY CASE. IN THE HUEY CASE, THE VICTIM RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE CALLING
FOR HELP FROM THE POLICE. THE VICTIM GAVE -- THEN GAVE A STATEMENT TO
THE POLICE ABOUT THE EVENT THAT TRANSPIRED. IN OUR CASE, THE VICTIM RUNS
OUT AND SAYS, "HE'S TRYING TO KILL ME." SHE'S LITERALLY IN FLIGHT. SHE
GAVE A STATEMENT TO THE POLICE AFTER THEY HAD WRAPPED A COAT AROUND HER.
SHE TOLD THE POLICE THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD TOLD HER DURING THE BEATING
THAT HE WOULD KILL HER, AND THE DEFENDANT CONTINUED THE STRESS OF THE
INCIDENT THEN BY COMING OUTSIDE AND ACTUALLY YELLING AT HER WHILE THE
POLICE WERE THERE. THE REPEATING OF THE STATEMENT OF THE DEFENDANT,
"I'LL KILL YOU," CONSTITUTES COMPOUND HEARSAY, AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT.
HOWEVER, HIS STATEMENT IS AN ADMISSION OF WHAT HIS INTENT WAS UNDER
EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1220. HER EXCITED UTTERANCE COMES IN UNDER 1240.
SHE ALSO BLURTED SOMETHING OUT THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. SHE BLURTED OUT,
"YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS NEVER DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS," AND THAT'S A VERY
INTERESTING STATEMENT BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS I THINK WHAT'S VERY COMMON IN
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES; THE FRUSTRATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.
AND HISTORICALLY, NOT A LOT HAS BEEN DONE FOR BATTERED WOMEN, EXPLAINS
WHY SHE STAYED WITH HIM, WHICH IS THE QUESTION PROBABLY THE JURY IS
GOING TO HAVE, THAT SHE DIDN'T FEEL PROTECTED; AND INDEED, SHE WASN'T
PROTECTED. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO TO NOTE THAT DEFENDANT'S APOLOGY
LETTERS WITH REGARD TO THIS INCIDENT ARE ALSO A HALLMARK OF DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE. THERE'S A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THAT OCCURS. IT'S A THREE-PART
CYCLE. BASICALLY YOU HAVE THE TENSION BUILDING PHASE. TENSION BUILDING
PHASE INVOLVES EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE; TENSIONS ARE BUILDING UP.
THEN YOU HAVE ACUTE BATTERING PHASE. WE ARE LOOKING -- IN THIS INCIDENT,
WE'RE LOOKING AT AN ACUTE BATTERING INCIDENT. HE HITS HER. HE'S RAGING.
HE'S OUT OF CONTROL. AND THEN THERE'S A THIRD PHASE, THE CONTRITION
PHASE, THE LOVING RESPIT WHERE VERY CHARACTERISTICALLY, WHAT A DEFENDANT
WILL SAY IS, HE'LL SAY, "I AM SORRY," SENDS FLOWERS. AND WE KNOW THE
DEFENDANT SENDS FLOWERS. I MEAN HE LEAVES FLOWERS ON THE HOME OF HIS
EX-WIFE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE HE'S STALKING HER. THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT HE DOES, AND IT'S PART OF THE CONTRITION PHASE. YOUR
HONOR, I DO NOW HAVE IN COURT THE APOLOGY LETTERS THAT I REFERENCED
EARLIER. AND AT THE COURT'S PLEASURE, MAY I SIMPLY APPROACH? AND WHAT I
AM GOING TO DO -- I'M TRYING TO THINK HOW I CAN MARK THESE.

*THE COURT:* I THINK WE HAVE PHOTOCOPIES SOMEWHERE ALREADY.

*MS. BODIN:* YOU PROBABLY HAVE --

*MR. UELMEN:* THEY ARE ATTACHED TO THE MOTION FOR HANDWRITING EXEMPLAR.
WE HAVE STIPULATED TO MR. SIMPSON --

*MS. BODIN:* THEN WE ACCEPT THAT STIPULATION.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE RECORD FOR THIS HEARING,
WE WILL MARK BY REFERENCE THE EXHIBITS TO THE HANDWRITING EXEMPLAR
MOTION FILED BY THE PEOPLE, AND THOSE EXHIBITS WILL BE DEEMED EXHIBITS
-- THE EXHIBITS ATTACHED TO THAT MOTION WILL BE EXHIBITS FOR THE PURPOSE
OF THIS HEARING COLLECTIVELY AS PEOPLE'S 4. THANK YOU.

(PEO'S 4 FOR ID = EXHIBITS ATTACHED TO EXEMPLAR MOTION)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MS. BODIN, I DO HAVE THOSE AGAIN IN FRONT OF ME.
I DID READ THEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF RULING ON THE MOTION FOR HANDWRITING
EXEMPLAR.

*MS. BODIN:* ALL RIGHT.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. BODIN:* CAN I HAVE JUST A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MS. BODIN:* ALSO, YOUR HONOR, I HAVE A TRANSCRIPT OF THE TAPE WHICH THE
COURT SHOULD HAVE IN ITS DOCUMENTS. DOES THE COURT HAVE IT?

*THE COURT:* THE 1989?

*MS. BODIN:* YES.

*THE COURT:* I DON'T THINK I DO. I HAVE THE 1993 911 TAPE.

*MS. BODIN:* YOUR HONOR, I SPOKE TO MR. UELMEN. I DO HAVE A COPY OF THE
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT, AND AT THE COURT'S PLEASURE -- WHAT I CAN DO IS
MARK IT I BELIEVE P --

*THE COURT:* 5.

*MS. BODIN:* 5, YEAH, IN THE LOWER RIGHT-HAND CORNER. MAY I PRESENT THAT
TO THE COURT?

*THE COURT:* PLEASE.

(PEO'S 5 FOR ID = PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT)

*MS. BODIN:* YOUR HONOR, DID YOU SAY YOU HAD THE TRANSCRIPT OR NOT?

*THE COURT:* NO. I INDICATED I HAD NOT SEEN IT.

*MR. DARDEN:* 1989?

*THE COURT:* 1989. CORRECT.

*MS. BODIN:* THAT WILL BE MARKED P-6, YOUR HONOR. MR. GORDON IS GOING TO
BRING THAT TO YOU.

(PEO'S 6 FOR ID = TRANSCRIPT)

*MS. BODIN:* I'M NOT GOING TO PRESENT THE COURT WITH THE SWORN
DEPOSITION, BUT I KNOW WE WILL -- AT TRIAL TIME BE DOING THAT. I'M GOING
TO ARGUE TO THIS COURT THAT THE --

*THE COURT:* WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME TWO SECONDS TO READ THE TRANSCRIPT.

*MS. BODIN:* I AM SORRY, YOUR HONOR. I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED AT ME, YOUR
HONOR. I APOLOGIZE.

*THE COURT:* NO.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. I'VE READ PEOPLE'S 6. MISS BODIN.

*MS. BODIN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. I'M NOW GOING TO ARGUE TO THIS COURT
THAT THE STATEMENT THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON MADE AND THEN HER
SUBSEQUENT STATEMENT TO THE POLICE ARE ADMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO 1240.
THERE WAS CLEARLY STARTLING OCCURRENCE. THERE'S LOTS OF EVIDENCE TO SHOW
THAT SHE WAS RUNNING, THE DEFENDANT BASICALLY IS COMING OUT RIGHT AFTER
HER ROARING AT HER. BASICALLY THE POLICE ARE COMING TO AN INCIDENT THAT
IS IN PROGRESS. IT IS A STARTLING OCCURRENCE. HER NERVOUS EXCITEMENT
SURELY DOMINATED. SHE IS RUNNING OUT IN SWEATS AND A BRA TO A MALE
POLICE OFFICER SCREAMING, "HE'S GOING TO KILL ME." I CAN'T IMAGINE A
STRONGER CASE FOR NERVOUS EXCITEMENT DOMINATING AT THE TIME OF AN
UTTERANCE. BUT THEN THE DEFENDANT COMES OUT AND HE EXTENDS THE TRAUMA TO
HER BY YELLING AT HER SUCH THAT SHE HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO A POLICE CAR
AND MAKES A STATEMENT TO THE POLICE. NOW, CLEARLY HER STATEMENT TO THE
POLICE INCLUDED SOME QUESTIONING. THE QUESTIONING IS NOT A BAR TO THE
ADMISSION OF 1240 STATEMENTS, AND FARMER DOES STAND FOR THAT
PROPOSITION. AND IN FACT, IN FARMER, WHICH CONSTITUTES ADMISSIONS OF A
911 TAPE PURSUANT TO 1240, THERE'S LOTS OF QUESTIONING BY A DISPATCHER.
IN FACT, IT'S ARGUABLE THAT THE STATEMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS CASE ARE
EVEN MORE SPONTANEOUS BECAUSE IN THE FARMER CASE, THE 911 OPERATOR
ACTUALLY HAD CALLED THE HOME BACK AND SHE TALKED TO TWO SEPARATE PEOPLE.
FIRST SHE TALKED TO THE VICTIM'S SISTER AND THEN SHE TALKED TO THE
VICTIM IN FARMER. IN THIS CASE, WE HAVE A WOMAN BASICALLY RUNNING OUT IN
THE MIDST OF A TRANSACTION AND MAKING A STATEMENT. WE'VE MET EVERY
ELEMENT OF 1240. WE ARE GOING TO ASK THE COURT TO ADMIT HER STATEMENTS
AS WELL AS THE CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, THE 911 TAPES, THE SCREAMING, THE
PICTURES, THREE APOLOGY LETTERS, THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT, SUBSEQUENTLY
A TRIAL MEDICAL RECORD, SWORN DEPOSITION, AND WE DO HAVE A TAPE, I
SHOULD TELL THE COURT THAT, ALTHOUGH I'M NOT GOING TO PRESENT IT IN THIS
HEARING, WHERE THE DEFENDANT TALKS ABOUT THIS ON ESPN, TALKS ABOUT THIS
INCIDENT, HE MINIMIZES IT, HE SAYS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, SAYS -- AT ONE
POINT, HE TELLS OFFICER FARRELL ON A LATER OCCASION FROM THE LOS ANGELES
POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING I
THINK IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BECAUSE BATTERERS
TYPICALLY MINIMIZE WHAT THEY DO. THEY REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT
OF WHAT THEY DO. BUT THEY DO BEAT. AND THIS DEFENDANT HIT HER ON THIS
OCCASION. I'M ASKING THE COURT TO ENTER THAT STATEMENT PURSUANT TO 1240,
HER SUBSEQUENT STATEMENT TO THE POLICE. IN 1988 TO 1989, THERE WAS AN
INCIDENT WITNESSED BY ALFRED ACOSTA, A LIMOUSINE DRIVER, WHEREIN HE SAW
THE DEFENDANT BACKHAND NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON IN THE CAR. WHAT WAS NOT
MENTIONED IN THE DEFENDANT'S PRESENTATION OF FACTS WAS THAT SHE WAS SO
FRIGHTENED APPARENTLY THAT SHE INVITED A LIMOUSINE DRIVER INTO HER
HOUSE, ARGUABLY TO PROTECT HERSELF. AND WHEN THEY GOT IN THE HOUSE, HE
SAW THE DEFENDANT ACTUALLY LUNGE AT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, YET ANOTHER
EXAMPLE OF A STRONG AND CONSISTENT THEME OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE ONCE AGAIN
APPEARING IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM. IN
1989, THERE WAS AN INCIDENT THAT WAS WITNESSED BY JULIENNE HENDRICKS AND
DENISE BROWN THAT OCCURRED AT THE MALIBU RED ONION. MR. UELMEN
EUPHEMISTICALLY CHARACTERIZED THIS AS A VERBAL ARGUMENT. THE TRUE FACTS
OF THIS INCIDENT ARE THIS: THAT THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM WERE
PRESENT AT THE MALIBU RED ONION WITH JULIENNE HENDRICKS AND DENISE
BROWN. IN PUBLIC, THE DEFENDANT GRABBED THE CROTCH OF NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON AND SAID, "THIS IS MINE. THIS IS WHERE MY CHILDREN COME FROM."
THIS ISN'T A BUMPY MARRIAGE. THIS ISN'T A VERBAL ARGUMENT. THIS IS OUT
AND OUT DENIGRATION AND PUBLIC HUMILIATION. BUT IT DIDN'T STOP THERE,
BECAUSE WHEN IT GOT TO THE CAR, THE DEFENDANT ACTUALLY PUSHED HER OUT OF
THE CAR. WE THEN HAVE AN INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED IN 1991 WHERE EDDIE
REYNOZA HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE DEFENDANT WHERE HE TOLD REYNOZA THAT
IF HE CAUGHT ANY ONE OF HIS WIFE'S BOYFRIENDS DRIVING ANY OF HIS CARS,
HE WOULD QUOTE, CUT HIS FUCKING HEAD OFF. AND THAT DISPLAYS THE
DEFENDANT'S JEALOUSY, HIS NEED TO CONTROL NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND IT IS
CHARACTERISTIC OF A BATTERING RELATIONSHIP AND IS PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE
CASE LAW THAT I'VE ALREADY CITED TO THE COURT. IN 1992, NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON SEPARATED FROM THE DEFENDANT. JUDITHA BROWN, THE MOTHER OF
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, HEARD THE DEFENDANT SAY WHENEVER HE SAW NICOLE
WITH ANOTHER MAN, THAT HE COMPLAINED THAT HE WAS PAYING FOR THAT MAN'S
MEALS, YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE DEFENDANT'S JEALOUSY. I SHOULD ADD,
YOU KNOW, THE DEFENSE HAS TAKEN EACH ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS AND PICKED
IT APART AND THE DEFENSE HAS SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW, HOW IS THIS RELEVANT
TO A MURDER THAT OCCURRED IN 1994?" THESE ACTS WHEN TAKEN AS A WHOLE
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS POSSESSIVE, THAT HE WAS JEALOUS, THAT
HE NEEDED TO DOMINATE, THAT HE NEEDED TO CONTROL NOT JUST BY USING
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS A VERY GOOD TOOL FOR CONTROLLING
SOMEBODY, BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN CONTROL SOMEBODY. YOU CAN
CONTROL SOMEBODY WITH JEALOUSY BY PUBLIC HUMILIATION AND ALL THE WAYS
THAT I TALKED ABOUT, PROPERTY DAMAGE. AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
THAT TYPE OF CONTROL. AFTER THEY SEPARATED, THE DEFENDANT ALSO TOLD
JUDITHA BROWN THAT HE SHOULD LET HER GO, "BUT I CAN'T LET HER GO. I
CAN'T LET HER GO," YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HIS JEALOUSY, HIS
OBSESSIVENESS, HIS NEED TO POSSESS HER. THEY TRIED TO RECONCILE, BUT
COULD NOT AND TRIED TO RECONCILE FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD. THE QUESTION I
THINK, AND IT WILL ARISE CERTAINLY IN THE MINDS OF THE JURY, WELL, WHY
WOULD A BATTERED WOMAN EVER RECONCILE WITH HER BATTERER? THERE'S A LOT
OF REASONS WHY A BATTERED WOMAN WOULD RECONCILE WITH A BATTERER. NUMBER
ONE, WE KNOW FROM THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OR THE EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT A
BATTERED WOMAN IS IN MORE DANGER WHEN SHE SEPARATES THAN WHEN SHE STAYS.
SHE HAS EVERY REASON TO BE AFRAID THAT WHEN SHE LEAVES HIM, SHE'S IN
MORE DANGER. SHE IS TO PLACATE, TO MODERATE, TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION.
EXPERT CAN SPEAK TO THIS. AND WHAT MAY BE TO THE DEFENSE SEEMINGLY
UNIMPORTANT EVENTS DEPICT A CLASSIC PATTERN OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, A
CLASSIC PATTERN THAT SPEAKS TO PERMISSIBLE 1101(B) PURPOSES. IN 1993,
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND SOME FRIENDS WENT TO THE CALIFORNIA SUSHI
RESTAURANT. AND THERE IS -- THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT THAT ENSUED. AND THERE
WAS A POLICE OFFICER, OFFICER ECKERT FROM THE HERMOSA BEACH POLICE
DEPARTMENT, WHO WROTE A MEMORANDUM WITH REGARD TO THIS INCIDENT WHEREIN
HE SAW THE DEFENDANT YELLING IN PUBLIC AT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WHILE SHE
WAS SITTING ON A CURB. IT IS YET AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF HUMILIATION. THERE
HAD BEEN AN ARGUMENT AT THIS POINT OVER A MAN THAT NICOLE HAD GONE OUT
WITH, AN EXAMPLE OF JEALOUSY. AND IN FACT, THE DEFENDANT WAS SO ANGRY
THAT HE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED ANOTHER WOMAN INTO A BATHROOM AT THE
RESTAURANT. IN 1993, IN OCTOBER, WE HAVE ANOTHER BREAKING AND ENTERING
OR ANOTHER PROPERTY DAMAGE INCIDENT AT THE GRETNA GREEN RESIDENCE OF
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. WE HAVE A SERIES OF 911 TAPES WHERE NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON CALLS AND REQUESTS THE POLICE TO HELP. ON THOSE 911 TAPES, THE
VOICE OF THE DEFENDANT ON THE SECOND TAPE CAN BE HEARD SWEARING, FILTHY
LANGUAGE, MAKING REFERENCES TO SEEING NICOLE WITH KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH,
YELLING, SCREAMING. AND THE NET RESULT OF THAT IS THAT THERE WAS A
BROKEN DOWN DOOR AT THE GRETNA GREEN RESIDENCE. THERE IS A BASIS FOR THE
ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENTS MADE ON THE 911 TAPE. THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO
SEPARATE CALLS. BASIS FOR THE ADMISSION ARE AS FOLLOWS: NUMBER ONE,
EXCITED UTTERANCES UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1240. NUMBER TWO,
CONTEMPORANEOUS UTTERANCES, BECAUSE WHAT IS DEPICTED ON THESE 911 TAPES
IS A TRANSACTION IN PROGRESS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE DEFENDANT IN THE
BACKGROUND AND YOU CAN HEAR NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON TALKING ABOUT THE DOOR
BEING BROKEN IN. THERE ARE ADMISSIONS MADE BY THE DEFENDANT WITH REGARD
TO THE INCIDENTS INVOLVING KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH. THE DEFENSE HAS MADE THE
POINT THAT WE CANNOT ENTER HER STATEMENT, THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS GOING,
AND I QUOTE, FUCKING NUTS AS INADMISSIBLE OPINION EVIDENCE. AND I'LL
ADDRESS THAT IN A MINUTE. IT IS NOT INADMISSIBLE OPINION EVIDENCE.
FURTHERMORE, THE 911 TAPES FALL WITHIN THE BUSINESS RECORD EXCEPTION
UNDER 1271, BUT WE STILL MUST NEED A HEARSAY EXCEPTION, AND I UNDERSTAND
THAT. AND FINALLY, THERE'S AN ARGUMENT MADE WITH REGARD TO RIGHTS TO
CONFRONTATION IN THE ENTRANCE OF A HEARSAY STATEMENT INTO COURT. AND I
AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE. AND I'LL START FIRST WITH THE
CONTEMPORANEOUS UTTERANCE. A CONTEMPORANEOUS UTTERANCE IS OFFERED TO
EXPLAIN THE CONDUCT OF A DECLARANT, AND IT'S MADE WHILE AN INCIDENT IS
IN PROGRESS. THERE ARE STATEMENTS MADE ON THE TAPE WHILE THIS INCIDENT
WAS IN PROGRESS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE VOICE OF THE DEFENDANT, AS
I'VE SAID PREVIOUSLY. FURTHERMORE, SOME OF THESE STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE
ADMISSIONS PURSUANT TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1220. AN ADMISSION IS ANY
STATEMENT OFFERED WHEN IT CAN INCRIMINATE, AND THESE ARE INCRIMINATING
STATEMENTS SIMPLY BY THE RAGE AND THE OBSCENITY DISPLAYED AND THE FACT
THAT HE'S BREAKING INTO HER HOUSE AND BREAKING DOWN THE DOOR IS
INCRIMINATING. THE FACT THAT HE ADMITS TO WATCHING HER IN ACTIVE
INTIMACY WITH KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH IS ALSO AN ADMISSION. FURTHERMORE, IT'S
AN EXCITED UTTERANCE UNDER 1240. NOW, I'VE TALKED ABOUT EXCITED
UTTERANCE IN MY PREVIOUS ARGUMENT. COUNSEL HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS WAS
A 14-MINUTE CONVERSATION. WELL, IT'S TWO PHONE CALLS AND THE DISPATCHER
IS QUESTIONING HER WHILE THIS LITERALLY IS GOING ON. AND AGAIN, IT'S
SIMILAR TO FARMER WHERE THERE IS QUESTIONING GOING ON, VERY EXTENDED
QUESTIONING. THAT DOES NOT DEPRIVE THE UTTERANCES OF SPONTANEITY AS
REQUIRED BY 1240. SHE'S NARRATING THE EVENT AND IT'S MADE UNDER THE
STRESS OF EXCITEMENT. SHE WAS LITERALLY BEING ASSAULTED THE WHOLE TIME
THAT THESE 911 TAPES WERE GOING ON. AND THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF
INADMISSIBLE OPINION EVIDENCE. WELL, THERE'S A CASE RIGHT ON POINT, AND
THAT'S THE CASE OF PEOPLE V. GARCIA. WHAT THAT CASE STATES IS THAT THIS
TYPE OF STATEMENT CAN COME IN. AND WHAT -- IN THE GARCIA CASE, THE
VICTIM STATED, "HE'S GOING CRAZY. HE IS GOING TO KILL ME." THIS IS VERY
SIMILAR TO THE STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS CASE. AND WHEN MR. UELMEN MADE
HIS FACTUAL PRESENTATION, HE SAID THAT SHE NEVER FELT THREATENED, AND
THAT SIMPLY IS NOT TRUE. SHE DID FEEL THREATENED. IN FACT, I QUOTE -- I
BELIEVE SHE STATES THAT, "HE'S GOING TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF ME." THAT'S
CORRECT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID. AND IN THE TRANSCRIPT -- YEAH. AT
PAGE 3, LINE 21 -- I'M NOW SHOWING IT TO COUNSEL -- THE 911 OPERATOR
ASSISTED HER SAYS, "OKAY, STAY ON THE LINE." SHE SAYS, "I DON'T WANT TO
STAY ON THE LINE. HE IS GOING TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF ME." THEY'RE
QUOTES. YOUR HONOR, I'M GOING TO MARK THIS AS P-7.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. TRANSCRIPT OF THE 911 TAPE. I TAKE IT THAT'S
BOTH TAPES?

*MS. BODIN:* IT'S THE FIRST ONE, YOUR HONOR. AND THE SECOND ONE IS BEING
TRANSCRIBED AND WE HAVE GIVEN COPIES OF IT, OF THE TAPE TO THE DEFENSE,
AND I BELIEVE WE'VE GIVEN A COPY OF THE FIRST TAPE, THE TRANSCRIPT TO
THE DEFENSE. I GUESS -- I KNOW MR. UELMEN IS LOOKING AT IT, SO I KNOW
FOR SURE HE HAS IT.

(PEO'S 7 FOR ID = TRANSCRIPT OF 911 TAPE)

*THE COURT:* LET ME JUST CHECK AND SEE IF THIS IS THE ONE I HAVE.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MS. BODIN:* FINALLY, WITH REGARD TO THE CONFRONTATION ISSUE, A NUMBER
OF CASES HAVE HELD IF THE HEARSAY EXCEPTION CAN BE MET, THE
CONFRONTATION RIGHTS OF A DEFENDANT ARE NOT VIOLATED. AND THREE CASES
STAND FOR THAT PROPOSITION, ALTHOUGH THAT'S THE CONSISTENT THEME
THROUGHOUT ALL HEARSAY EXCEPTION CASES. BUT THE CASE OF FARMER THAT I'VE
ALREADY CITED TO THE COURT AT PAGE 905 TO 906 AND IN THE HUEY CASE AT
PAGE 1388 TO 1394 -- THERE'S A THIRD CASE I'LL GIVE TO THE COURT, PEOPLE
V. TRIPLE BALANCE AT 5 CAL. APP. 4TH 1235, ALL STANDING FOR THE
PROPOSITION THAT ADMISSION OF HEARSAY DOES NOT VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF THE
DEFENDANT WITH REGARD TO CONFRONTATION. IN 1993, WHILE NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON WAS LIVING AT GRETNA GREEN, SHE HAD NEIGHBORS, AND THE NEIGHBORS
SAW THE DEFENDANT ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS OUTSIDE HER HOUSE. ON ONE
OCCASION, THEY ACTUALLY CALLED THE POLICE. THEY BELIEVED THIS HAPPENED
SOMETIME SHORTLY AFTER NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON HAD GONE TO CABO SAN LUCAS.
THEY SAW MR. SIMPSON OUTSIDE HER HOME LURKING AROUND AND TRYING TO LOOK
IN THE WINDOWS. THEY ACTUALLY CALLED 911, AND THEN THE POLICE CAME TO
THIS INCIDENT. THEY ALSO SAW THE DEFENDANT LEAVE FLOWERS ON HER
DOORSTEP. AND THOUGH MR. UELMEN PERHAPS HAS TRIED TO CHARACTERIZE THIS
AS SOMEHOW NORMAL OR SOMETHING THAT GOES ON WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN, I
FIND IT ODD SOMEONE WOULD LEAVE FLOWERS AND BE HANGING AROUND THE
WINDOWS OF THE HOME OF SOMEBODY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT EVEN IF YOU
HAD BEEN MARRIED TO THEM BEFORE. AND TO CHARACTERIZE THIS AS BEING IN
ANY WAY NORMAL OR CHARACTERISTIC OF A SO-CALLED BUMPY MARRIAGE IS SIMPLY
A MISCHARACTERIZATION. ON ONE OCCASION, THEY ACTUALLY SAW HIM BARGE IN
ON HER. THEN THERE ARE INCIDENTS WITH REGARD TO KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH. THE
DEFENDANT ACTUALLY ADMITTED THAT HE HAD SEEN NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND
KEITH IN AN ACT OF INTIMACY, THAT HE HAD LOOKED IN THE WINDOW. AND I
BELIEVE THAT MR. UELMEN TALKED ABOUT THIS AS BEING CIVILIZED BEHAVIOR
AND THAT WHAT WAS AN OTHERWISE OUTRAGEOUS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS ESSENTIALLY
WELL HANDLED BY THE DEFENDANT. BUT MY QUESTION TO THIS COURT AND TO MR.
UELMEN IS, WHO CREATED THE OUTRAGE HERE? THE OUTRAGE IS THAT THE
DEFENDANT WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW WHERE HE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO
BUSINESS BEING THERE, NONE WHATSOEVER. AND IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME HE
DID THAT. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TESTIMONY -- RATHER THE
INTERVIEWS WITH THE COLBY'S. AND FURTHERMORE, WE KNOW FROM MR.
ZLOMSOWITCH THAT HE SHOWED UP ONE NIGHT WHEN SHE WAS HAVING DINNER AT
MEZALUNA. HE WENT INTO THE RESTAURANT, ACTUALLY SAT THERE AND STARED AT
HER. THAT IS -- IN FRONT OF HER FRIENDS IS LITERALLY PUBLICLY
HUMILIATING. HE ALSO ON ANOTHER OCCASION AT A RESTAURANT CALLED TRYST,
T-R-Y-S-T, TOLD KEITH THAT NICOLE WAS STILL HIS WIFE, AND HE SAT THERE
ONCE AGAIN IN THE RESTAURANT AND STARED AT THEM. HE STALKS, HE STARES,
HE HUMILIATES IN PUBLIC. STALKING IS ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF HUMILIATING
BEHAVIOR. IT LITERALLY STEALS THE SECURITY AWAY FROM ITS VICTIM. AND IN
FACT, WE KNOW THAT THE SECURITY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS BEING STOLEN
AWAY FROM HER LITTLE BY LITTLE BECAUSE AS WE GET LATER AND LATER IN HER
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEFENDANT, SHE IS CONTINUALLY EXPRESSING MORE AND
MORE FEAR. SHE'S TELLING EVERYBODY SHE'S AFRAID OF HIM. AND YET ANOTHER
STALKING INCIDENT IN 1994 WHEN SHE WAS HAVING COFFEE WITH JEFFEREY
KELLER AND RON GOLDMAN, THE DEFENDANT SUDDENLY APPEARED AND HE PARKED
ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND LIKE MOTIONED TO HER, "COME ON
OVER HERE." AND SHE DID. SHE WENT OVER THERE. THIS WAS WITNESSED BY
JEFFEREY KELLER AND IT'S I THINK INTERESTING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT
WOULD ALLOW THE DEFENDANT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHO MR. GOLDMAN WAS. WE
KNOW THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM PREVIOUSLY. ONCE AGAIN, AN INCIDENT OF
STALKING AND HUMILIATION.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MS. BODIN, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH FOR
A MOMENT. LET'S CHANGE COURT REPORTERS.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS BODIN.

*MS. BODIN:* THANK YOU. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS THAT THE
VICTIM MADE WITH REGARD TO HER FEAR. IN FACT, SHE TOLD A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE VERY CLOSE TO THE ACTUAL MURDERING INCIDENT ABOUT HER FEAR. SHE
TOLD HER MOTHER THAT EVERYWHERE SHE WENT SHE SAW THE DEFENDANT. HE WAS
AT THE PAYLESS SHOE STORE WHEN HE WENT THERE AND HE WAS FOLLOWING HER IN
HER CAR. SHE TOLD BETSY ROCKETT, TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ACTUAL KILLING
OCCURRED, THAT HE WAS PEEPING -- THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS PEEPING IN ON
HER AND HE WAS STARTING TO WEAR DISGUISES. HE TOLD KRIS JENNER THAT SHE
BELIEVED THAT HE WOULD KILL HER. NOW, MR. UELMEN HAS TALKED ABOUT THE
INABILITY OF THE PEOPLE TO USE STATEMENTS OF FEAR. AND IF WE STOPPED AT
THE ARGUMENT THAT MR. UELMEN MADE, THAT WOULD BE A CORRECT ARGUMENT, BUT
MR. UELMEN DIDN'T MAKE THE COMPLETE ARGUMENT. THE ARGUMENT -- THE GOOD
ARGUMENT UNDER 1240, AND THAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT STATEMENTS OF FEAR
CAN COME IN WHEN YOU CAN SHOW CONDUCT IN CONFORMITY AND WE DO HAVE
CONDUCT IN CONFORMITY PURSUANT TO 1240 TODAY. WE HAVE RECEIVED
INFORMATION FROM SOJOURN SHELTER THAT ON THE DATE OF JUNE THE 7TH, 1994,
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON MADE A CONTACT WITH SOJOURN. SHE COMPLAINED THAT
SHE WAS BEING STALKED. SHE WAS AFRAID, SHE FELT CONFUSED, SHE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO, AND SHE NAMED THE DEFENDANT AS THE PERSON WHO WAS
STALKING HER. SHE ACTED IN CONFORMITY WITH HER FEAR. PEOPLE WHO ARE
AFRAID MADE CALLS FOR HER. THEY GO TO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SOJOURN,
SHELTERS FOR BATTERED WOMEN. AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT EXIST FOR BATTERED
WOMEN ARE THERE TO HELP THEM AND WOMEN GO TO THEM AND NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON WENT TO THAT PLACE BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID AND SHE HAD A REASON
TO BE AFRAID. AND I THINK THAT ACT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. IT IS
SIGNIFICANT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN THE LIGHT OF OTHER FACTS THAT
OCCURRED IN THAT TIME PERIOD. WE KNOW THAT VERY CLOSE IN TIME, RIGHT
AROUND THE MIDDLE OF MAY, THAT THE DEFENDANT GAVE THE VICTIM A BRACELET,
A VERY EXPENSIVE BRACELET FOR HER BIRTHDAY, AND THE DEFENDANT TALKS THAT
ABOUT THAT IN A STATEMENT TO THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THE
VICTIM GAVE IT BACK TO HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM
AGAIN. YOU HAVE AN ACT OF ESTRANGEMENT HERE AND ACTS OF ESTRANGEMENT, OF
DISTANCING, ARE VERY IMPORTANT, AND UNFORTUNATELY, VERY DANGEROUS FOR
BATTERED WOMEN. THEY ARE DANGEROUS. WHAT HAPPENS IS IT ESCALATES THE
VIOLENCE AND AN EXPERT CAN SPEAK TO THAT. THIS ACT OF ESTRANGEMENT, OF
GIVING BACK THE BRACELET, THE FINISHING OF THE RELATIONSHIP, THE ENDING
OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT HAD GONE ON FOR 17 YEARS PROVIDES A MOTIVE IN
THIS CASE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, A MOTIVE TO KILL,
THE FINAL ACT OF CONTROL. THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE THAT
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON KEPT AN ACCOUNTING, AN AUDIT TRAIL OF ACTS OF
VIOLENCE. WE -- WE HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO GO INTO THE SAFETY DEPOSIT
BOX OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE WENT IN THERE WAS THE
LETTERS OF APOLOGY, NEWSPAPER ARTICLES RELATIVE TO THE 1989 INCIDENT
WHEREIN THE DEFENDANT SUFFERED A CRIMINAL CONVICTION, FINALLY, FOR A
VIOLATION OF PENAL CODE SECTION 273.5. THERE WERE PICTURES, PICTURES
THAT WE HAVE AUTHENTICATED.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. BODIN:* PICTURES THAT WE HAVE AUTHENTICATED THROUGH HER SISTER,
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. THERE ARE THREE PICTURES. DENISE BROWN HAS
AUTHENTICATED TWO OF THOSE PICTURES AS BEING PICTURES THAT SHE TOOK OF
INCIDENTS WHERE THE DEFENDANT BEAT THE VICTIM. THOSE PICTURES DEPICT A
FACIAL BEATING AND THEN A VERY LARGE BRUISE UNDERNEATH THE ARM OF NICOLE
BROWN SIMPSON. SHE LITERALLY CREATED AN ACCOUNTING, AN AUDIT TRAIL OF
ACTS OF VIOLENCE, BECAUSE SHE WANTED SOMEBODY TO REMEMBER WHAT WAS GOING
ON IN HER LIFE, AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD BE
INTERPRETED. THERE WAS ALSO A WILL IN THAT SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX. THESE
ACTS AND THESE EXPRESSIONS OF FEAR ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE SHE
DID ACT IN CONFORMITY PURSUANT TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1240. THEY SHOW
THAT SHE WAS AFRAID, AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO A JURY WHO IS
GOING TO -- GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME REASONABLE INFERENCES WITH REGARD
TO HOW THIS KILLING OCCURRED. YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED
HERE. WE HAVE TO SHOW PREMEDITATION, ABILITY TO COMMIT THE MURDER. A
JURY COULD MAKE SOME REASONABLE INFERENCES, COULD AND SHOULD MAKE SOME
INFERENCES WITH REGARD TO THE STATE OF MIND OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. FOR
EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, WHY DID SHE GO OUTSIDE, WHAT TIME SHE GOES OUTSIDE,
IF SHE WAS REALLY AFRAID, WHAT DID SHE DO?

THIS IS RELEVANT -- THIS IS RELEVANT TO HER CONDUCT AND TO HER GOING TO
A SHELTER. HER FEAR IS RELEVANT. IT DOESN'T GO --

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. BODIN:* I MEANT 1250, I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR, 1250 OF THE EVIDENCE
CODE. I SAID 1240 SO MUCH TODAY THAT IT IS JUST COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH.
AND I WOULD ALSO ASK THE COURT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE COUPLE OF CASES
WITH REGARD TO THE ISSUE OF -- OF ENTERING STATEMENTS OF A VICTIM'S
FEAR. THERE IS ONE CASE IN 1963, WHICH IS STILL GOOD LAW, WHERE THE
STATEMENT OF THE VICTIM THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD TRIED TO KILL HER
PREVIOUSLY WAS USED TO SHOW THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE HOME IF SHE
KNEW THAT SHE -- IF SHE KNEW THAT THE PERPETRATOR WOULD BE THERE. AND
THEN THERE IS THE OTHER CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS PENN WHERE THE CONDUCT OF
THE VICTIM AND HER EXPRESSIONS OF FEAR WERE RELEVANT TO HER LACK OF
STRUGGLE IN A MURDER CASE. WE HAVE CITED THOSE CASES IN OUR BRIEF.

*THE COURT:* HOW DO YOU TIE THAT INTO THE FACTS OF THIS CASE, THE
RELEVANCE OF THE STATE OF MIND OF THE VICTIM?

*MS. BODIN:* OKAY. WE HAVE GOTTEN EVIDENCE TODAY FROM A SHELTER SHOWING
THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WENT THERE. RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THAT SHE --

*MR. COCHRAN:* OBJECTION. SHE IS WRONG ABOUT THOSE FACTS. THAT DOESN'T
SHOW THAT, YOUR HONOR. THAT IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS.

*MS. BODIN:* SHE CONTACTED THEM. IS THAT FAIR?

*MR. COCHRAN:* THAT'S FAIR.

*MS. BODIN:* SHE CONTACTED A SHELTER AND THOSE STATEMENTS OF FEAR THAT
SHE IS MAKING RIGHT AROUND THAT TIME PERIOD, AROUND THE KILLING WHEN SHE
IS GOING TO THE SHELTER, THIS IS A VERY TIGHT TIME NEXUS, SHE IS MAKING
STATEMENTS OF FEAR TO PEOPLE ABOUT TWO WEEKS --

*THE COURT:* FIVE DAYS.

*MS. BODIN:* BUT THE STATEMENTS OF FEAR ACTUALLY WERE TWO WEEKS BEFORE
THE MURDER. THE CONTACT WITH THE SHELTER WAS FIVE DAYS BEFORE. THOSE
STATEMENTS OF FEAR ARE RELATIVE TO HER CONDUCT AND HER FEAR AND THAT SHE
HAD REASON TO BE AFRAID. IN ANY CASE, THOSE ACTS, THOSE ACTS OF GOING TO
A SHELTER ARE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD COME IN. THEY SHOULD JUST COME IN,
THAT SHE MADE THIS CONTACT, ACTS THAT STAND ALONE WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY
STATEMENT, BECAUSE THEY ARE RELEVANT TO HER FEAR.

THE DEFENDANT ALSO MADE A STATEMENT TO JUDITHA BROWN SAYING THAT, "THE
ONLY WOMAN THAT I WANT IN MY LIFE IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND IF I CAN'T HAVE
HER," UMM -- "AND I CAN'T HAVE HER." AND IT SHOWS A DESIRE TO CONTROL.
HE WANTS HER. AND ALTHOUGH IT IS A STATEMENT JUST STANDING LOAN, IT IS A
SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT BECAUSE IT SHOWS HIS MOTIVE, HIS DESIRE TO CONTROL
HER AND THAT IS WHAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS ABOUT, MOTIVE TO CONTROL.
THERE IS A COMMENT THAT THE DEFENDANT MADE TO BILL THIBODEAU WITH REGARD
TO THE SECRET WAY, THE SECRET WAY INTO THE LOCATION OF WHERE THE CRIME
OCCURRED. THAT GOES TO OPPORTUNITY AND KNOWLEDGE, WHICH IS NOT AN
ARGUMENT THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY MADE IN OUR BRIEF, BUT IT DOES GO TO
OPPORTUNITY AND KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY TO COMMIT THE CRIME, AND IT IS
SIGNIFICANT. HE ALSO HEARD A STATEMENT FROM THE DEFENDANT SAYING THAT
NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS RIPPING HIM UP AND THAT SHE WASN'T WORTH THE
TROUBLE, INDICATING, I WOULD THINK, ALMOST A WILLINGNESS TO DISREGARD
HER, SHE WASN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE, RIPPING ME UP, GET RID OF HER, SHE
WASN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE. THE ACTS OF ABUSE THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED TO THE
COURT SHOW A LONG AND CONSISTENT PATTERN OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ONE OF
THOSE INCIDENTS STANDING ALONE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ALL THAT
SIGNIFICANT. SOME OF THEM OF COURSE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT, CERTAINLY WHEN
POLICE ARE CALLED TO A HOME AND THERE HAS BEEN A BEAT UP IS VERY
SIGNIFICANT, BUT STATEMENTS IS ISOLATED INCIDENTS, SEEMINGLY ISOLATED
INCIDENTS TAKEN ALONE. MR. UELMEN HAS MADE -- MADE THE POINT THAT, WELL,
HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO A 1994 MURDER CASE? TAKEN ALONE THEY DON'T.
TOGETHER WHAT THEY SHOW IS A COMPELLING PATTERN OF VIOLENCE. THEY SHOW
THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WAS IN DANGER 17 YEARS AGO AND THAT PATTERN OF
DANGER AND THAT PATTERN OF VIOLENCE ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN HER KILLING.
WE WOULD ASK THE COURT TO ADMIT THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE THAT WE HAVE TALKED
ABOUT IN OUR BRIEF. IF THE COURT WISHED TO QUESTION ME ABOUT SPECIFIC
ACTS, I WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THAT AT THIS POINT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO AT THIS POINT
IS TAKE OUR RECESS FOR THE DAY. I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO PREPARE FOR THE
COURT AND OPPOSING COUNSEL A LIST OF THE SPECIFIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE THAT
YOU ARE SEEKING TO ADMIT WITH A BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE LEGAL BASIS THAT
YOU FEEL COMPELS THE COURT TO ADMIT THEM, AND I WANT YOU TO PAY
PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO HOW THE VICTIM'S STATE OF MIND AND HER
STATEMENTS ARE RELEVANT TO ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE THE COURT
IN THIS CASE, BECAUSE THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT CLEAR IN MY MIND AT
THIS POINT.

*MS. BODIN:* ALL RIGHT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. I TAKE IT THAT I'M STILL GOING TO HEAR FROM MR.
GOLDBERG.

*MR. GOLDBERG:* YES, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* THEN FROM YOU AGAIN MR. GORDON?

*MR. GORDON:* YES, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* PERHAPS TESTIMONY?

*MR. GORDON:* YES, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* AND REBUTTAL?

*MR. UELMEN:* YES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE A FULL DAY TOMORROW.

*MR. GORDON:* THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, SIR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. DARDEN, YOU HAD A COMMENT YOU WANTED TO MAKE?

*MR. DARDEN:* I DON'T KNOW WHICH EVIDENCE ITEM WE ARE ON AT THIS POINT,
BUT I DO HAVE A BINDER HERE. IT CONTAINS MANY OF THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS
THAT WE HAVE BEEN ALLUDING TO HERE TODAY, AND I'M NOT IN THE POSITION TO
TAKE THESE BACK TO THE EVIDENCE LOCKER. AND SO THAT I DON'T SOMEHOW GET
CAUGHT UP IN A CHAIN OF CUSTODY, I WOULD LIKE TO MARK THESE AND DELIVER
THESE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS TO THE CLERK, IF I MAY, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* WHY DON'T WE DO THIS THEN: FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONTINUING
THE HEARING IN AN ORDERLY MANNER, I WILL DIRECT THE CONTENTS OF THAT
ENTIRE NOTEBOOK TO BE MARKED AS COURT'S EXHIBIT NEXT IN ORDER FOR THIS
HEARING ONLY.

*MR. DARDEN:* PEOPLE'S 8?

*THE COURT:* COURT'S EXHIBIT.

*THE CLERK:* COURT'S EXHIBIT 1.

(COURT'S 1 FOR ID = NOTEBOOK)

*THE COURT:* THIS IS JUST FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE CLERK TAKING POSSESSION
OF THE NOTEBOOK THIS EVENING. WE WILL RETURN IT TO YOU TOMORROW MORNING.

*MR. DARDEN:* ADDITIONALLY, YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE TO THE
COURT AND COUNSEL, AND PUT THEM ON NOTICE, THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED
EVIDENCE OF ANOTHER VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT AND SO WE WILL BE
MOVING, WITH LEAVE OF COURT, TO AMEND OUR PAPERS TOMORROW AFTERNOON
ALLEGING ANOTHER INCIDENT, IF NOT TWO ADDITIONAL INCIDENTS, DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. WE WILL STAND IN RECESS
UNTIL NINE O'CLOCK.
