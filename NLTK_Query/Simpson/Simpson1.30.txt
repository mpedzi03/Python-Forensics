*LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; MONDAY, JANUARY 30, 1995 9:10 A.M.*

DEPARTMENT NO. 103 HON. LANCE A. ITO, JUDGE

APPEARANCES: (APPEARANCES AS HERETOFORE NOTED,
MR. HODGMAN NOT BEING PRESENT.)

(JANET M. MOXHAM, CSR NO. 4855, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(CHRISTINE M. OLSON, CSR NO. 2378, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* GOOD MORNING, COUNSEL.

*MR. COCHRAN:* GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, YOU'VE EACH RECEIVED A PHOTOCOPY OF THE
COURT'S RULING REGARDING REQUEST FOR DISCOVERY SANCTIONS. MY APOLOGIES
TO COUNSEL FOR THE COURT'S FAILURE TO FAX YOU A COPY EARLIER THAN TODAY.
I EXPERIENCED A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN IN MY FAX PROGRAM AT HOME. I
ATTEMPTED TO FAX THIS TO ALL PARTIES YESTERDAY AND WAS APPARENTLY
OBVIOUSLY NOT ABLE TO DO SO. IF THE PARTIES WISH, I WILL GIVE THEM LEAVE
TO REVIEW THE RULING, AND I WOULD -- COURT'S RULING ASKS FOR INPUT FROM
BOTH PARTIES REGARDING OPENING STATEMENTS AND THE JURY INSTRUCTION.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES, I'VE READ IT. I'M READY TO PROCEED, YOUR HONOR, IF I
MIGHT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS CLARK.

*MS. CLARK:* I WOULD LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW IT MORE CAREFULLY,
YOUR HONOR. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE UP
WITH THE COURT AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONFER WITH COCOUNSEL
CONCERNING THE COURT'S RULING.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU THINK YOU NEED?

*MS. CLARK:* I WOULD LIKE TO AT LEAST UNTIL 1:30 TO ADDRESS THESE MATTERS.

*THE COURT:* WELL, LET ME -- MISS CLARK, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK
THE TWO ISSUES ARE THAT WE NEED TO RESOLVE THIS MORNING. YOU'VE SEEN THE
COURT'S RULING AND THE COURT'S PROPOSED JURY INSTRUCTION TO THE JURY TO
DISREGARD OPENING STATEMENT COMMENTS REGARDING THE WITNESSES THAT ARE
LISTED ON PAGE 4.

*MS. CLARK:* UH-HUH.

*THE COURT:* THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE INSTRUCTION THAT
YOU REQUESTED. YOU REQUESTED AN INSTRUCTION DIRECTING THE JURY TO
DISREGARD THE COMMENTS OF COUNSEL. I THINK THAT IS OVERBROAD, AND I
THINK THE ONLY REMEDY IS TO MENTION OR TO ASK THE JURY TO DISREGARD
DEFENSE COUNSEL'S REFERENCE TO THESE PARTICULAR WITNESSES OR IF THERE
ARE ANY OTHERS YOU FEEL THAT HAD BEEN MENTIONED IN THE RECORD THAT WHOSE
MENTION WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

*MS. CLARK:* I DON'T NECESSARILY TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT PART, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* DO YOU AGREE WITH THE LIST THE COURT HAS TAKEN FROM THE
RECORD?

*MS. CLARK:* THAT'S ONLY -- WITH RESPECT TO THIS AREA, I WAS REVIEWING
THE TRANSCRIPT LAST NIGHT AND I THOUGHT THAT THERE WERE MORE REFERENCES
TO OTHER WITNESSES.

*THE COURT:* WELL, THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR A DRAFT -- I SUGGEST -- I
ASKED BOTH SIDES FOR A PROPOSED INSTRUCTION BECAUSE I WAS SEEKING
PARTICULARITY WITH REGARDS TO THE COURT'S INSTRUCTION TO THE JURY. THIS
IS -- THE LIST THAT I HAVE HERE ON PAGE 4 AS A RESULT OF MY GOING
THROUGH THE RECORD LINE BY LINE NOTING WHERE THESE PERSONS HAD BEEN
MENTIONED AND THEN COMPARING IT WITH THE WITNESS LIST THAT HAD
PREVIOUSLY BEEN DISCLOSED.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE TO BE HEARD REGARDING THE
WITNESS LIST.

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY, MR. COCHRAN.

*MS. CLARK:* THERE ARE CERTAIN NOTABLE WITNESSES WHO ARE NOT MENTIONED
THAT WE SPECIFICALLY DELINEATED TO THE COURT WHEN WE WERE LAST IN
SESSION, EXPERT WITNESSES PROMISED BY THE DEFENSE ALTHOUGH NOT BY NAME
WHO HAVE NEVER EVEN BEEN DISCLOSED BY NAME TO THE PROSECUTION SUCH AS AN
EXPERT IN TIRE TRACKS, AN EXPERT IN SHOEPRINTS, AN EXPERT ON FINGER
CUTS, AN EXPERT ON RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. NONE OF THESE HAVE EVEN BEEN
NAMED TO US. AND THEN AGAIN, THE STATEMENTS MADE BY COUNSEL CONCERNING
ALLEGED CONCLUSIONS DRAWN BY EXPERTS DR. BADIN AND DR. LEE, WE HAVE NO
REPORTS, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT COUNSEL INTENDS TO PRESENT BY WAY OF THEIR
TESTIMONY, HAVING HAD NO DISCOVERY. SO THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT I WOULD
ADD TO THIS LIST AND THAT THE COURT IS AWARE OF WERE NOT DISCLOSED TO
THE PROSECUTION IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.

*THE COURT:* WELL, YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE COURT'S ORDER INCLUDES THOSE
SPECIFIC PERSONS, AND I MAKE REFERENCE TO THE TRANSCRIPT WHERE CERTAIN
EXPERT TESTIMONY IS MENTIONED AND IT INCLUDES THE ONES THAT YOU'VE JUST
LISTED NOW. AND I THINK THAT THE REQUIREMENT AT THIS POINT IS THAT THEY
BE DISCLOSED SINCE OBVIOUSLY THERE HAS BEEN INDICATED AN INTENTION TO
CALL THOSE PERSONS AS WITNESSES.

*MS. CLARK:* I DON'T -- WHERE DOES THE COURT INDICATE TO THE JURY THAT
THOSE EXPERTS HAVE BEEN --

*THE COURT:* NO, NO. WE'RE NOT THERE YET. FLIP BACK TO PAGE 2 WHERE WE
START WITH THE SECTION ON EXPERT WITNESSES. ALL RIGHT. FIRST FULL
PARAGRAPH AFTER THE QUOTATION FROM THE CODE SECTION, THERE'S AN ORDER
FROM THE COURT DIRECTING DISCLOSURE OF THESE PERSONS' REPORTS, ET
CETERA, ET CETERA, AND IN ADDITION, OTHER EXPERTS MENTIONED BY DEFENSE
COUNSEL AT THESE PARTICULAR PLACES IN THE TRANSCRIPT, WHICH INCLUDE THE
ONES THAT YOU'VE JUST MENTIONED.

*MS. CLARK:* IS THIS PART OF WHAT THE COURT PROPOSES TO SAY TO THE JURY?

*THE COURT:* NO, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT I NEED TO DO FIRST IS DETERMINE
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE BECAUSE THEY MAY BE PERSONS ALREADY DISCLOSED TO
YOU. BUT I'M CONCERNED -- MY CONCERN HERE IS ALSO THE REPORTS.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WELL, YOUR HONOR --

*MS. CLARK:* THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT MENTIONED BY NAME TO THE
JURY IN OPENING STATEMENT, THE -- THOSE WITNESSES -- THE PEOPLE ARE NOT
AWARE OF WHO THESE EXPERTS MIGHT BE EVEN BY NAME.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK, IF YOU READ THE FIRST SENTENCE, IT SAYS, "THE
DEFENSE IS THEREFORE ORDERED TO IMMEDIATELY DISCLOSE," BLAH, BLAH BLAH,
"AND THE IDENTITY OF THESE PERSONS."

*MS. CLARK:* I'M AWARE OF THAT, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* SO I ASSUME THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY. NOW, AFTER
YOU'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE, THEN YOU
CAN MAKE YOUR JUDGMENT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN
THE COURT'S INSTRUCTION TO THE JURY.

*MS. CLARK:* THEN I'M UNABLE AT THIS TIME TO INDICATE TO THE COURT WHAT
THE PEOPLE'S POSITION IS WITH RESPECT TO THIS RULING BECAUSE THERE'S
INFORMATION WE STILL DON'T HAVE.

*THE COURT:* WELL, IT'S A RULING. AFTER YOU RECEIVE -- AFTER YOU'VE HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK THAT OVER -- I'M GOING TO PROCEED TODAY. MY
INCLINATION IS TO INSTRUCT THE JURY AS I'VE INDICATED TODAY AND TO MOVE
ON WITH THE CASE. AND IF IT COMES TO LIGHT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE,
I CAN ALWAYS INSTRUCT THE JURY AS TO OTHER PARTICULARS.

*MS. CLARK:* WELL, THERE'S ALREADY AN INDICATION OF THERE ARE WITNESSES
NOT DISCLOSED TO US BY VIRTUE OF COUNSEL'S OPENING STATEMENT CONCERNING
THOSE EXPERTS.

*THE COURT:* WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET.

*MS. CLARK:* I'M TELLING THE COURT --

*THE COURT:* I HAVE THE SUSPICION THAT THE TIRE TRACK PERSON IS PROBABLY
DR. LEE.

*MS. CLARK:* SUSPICION IS CERTAINLY NOTHING --

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, IT'S NOT A SUSPICION. IT IS DR. HENRY LEE.

*MS. CLARK:* WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I FINALLY HEAR THIS TODAY THIS
MORNING. THE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO DISCOVERY, YOUR HONOR, NOT AN
ASSUMPTION AND NOT A SUSPICION.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE HAVE GIVEN --

*MS. CLARK:* WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD ANYTHING.

*THE COURT:* HOLD ON.

*MS. CLARK:* WE HAVEN'T SEEN A REPORT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. I AGREE. AND, MISS CLARK, THAT'S WHY I ORDERED
ITS IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE, WHICH IS TODAY.

*MS. CLARK:* AND I APPRECIATE THAT, YOUR HONOR, I REALLY DO. BUT I'M
ASKING FOR THE COURT TO INFORM THE JURY THAT WE WERE NOT INFORMED OF ANY
OF THAT EITHER. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED TO US AS WELL. NOT JUST
THESE WITNESSES, BUT THE EXPERTS AND WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO TESTIFY TO.
WHY DO WE FIND OUT ONLY IN OPENING STATEMENT THAT MR. COCHRAN INTENDS TO
CALL THESE EXPERT WITNESSES TO TESTIFY TO VARIOUS THINGS OF WHICH WE HAD
NO KNOWLEDGE? THE CODE REQUIRES THEM TO DO SO. THOSE EXPERTS AS HE
MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT, OF WHICH WE HAD NO DISCOVERY, AND
ONLY NOW BASED ON THE COURT'S STATED SUSPICION DO WE HEAR THAT THAT'S
WHO WAS GOING TO TESTIFY TO WHAT HE REPRESENTED TO THE JURY, FOR THE
FIRST TIME EVER WHEN WE HEARD IT, THAT'S A BLATANT VIOLATION AS WELL. WE
ARE ENTITLED TO KNOW --

*MR. COCHRAN:* WELL, YOUR HONOR --

*THE COURT:* HOLD ON. HOLD ON. MR. COCHRAN, YOU'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO RESPOND.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*MS. CLARK:* WE WERE ENTITLED TO KNOW ABOUT THOSE WITNESSES JUST AS WE
WERE ENTITLED TO KNOW ABOUT THE WITNESSES LISTED BY THE COURT IN ITS
ORDER. THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING FOR THE COURT TO INCLUDE THEM IN THE ORDER.
WHY WOULD THEY BE ANY DIFFERENT?

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION. WHAT IS YOUR
POSITION ON YOUR REQUEST TO REOPEN AT THIS TIME?

*MS. CLARK:* THE PEOPLE STRENUOUSLY URGE THE COURT TO ALLOW US TO
REOPEN. I WILL CITE TO THE COURT THE CIVIL CASE THAT I BROUGHT DOWN TO
COURT THE OTHER DAY. I KNOW THE COURT ALREADY HAS IT THROUGH LEXIS. BUT
IT DOES AUTHORIZE THE REOPENING OF OPENING STATEMENT. I WOULD LIKE FOR
THE COURT TO SEE THAT AND WE WOULD LIKE TO REOPEN. THE COURT HAS
REQUESTED A PROFFER AS TO WHAT WE WOULD ADDRESS IN THE OPENING STATEMENT --

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MS. CLARK:* AND WE WILL -- UNTIL MR. COCHRAN COMPLETES THE OPENING
STATEMENT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THE ENTIRETY OF IT BECAUSE
ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN REPRESENTED TO US WE HAVE FULL AND COMPLETE
DISCOVERY, WE OBVIOUSLY DO NOT. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER SURPRISES
ARE GOING TO BE FORTHCOMING FROM MR. COCHRAN. SO I'M NOT -- I CAN'T GIVE
A COMPLETE PROFFER AS TO WHAT WE WOULD STATE AT THIS TIME.

*THE COURT:* WELL, AS TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LISTED IN THE COURT'S
PROPOSED INSTRUCTION, AS TO THOSE LIMITED INDIVIDUALS, WHAT IS YOUR
PROFFER?

*MS. CLARK:* WELL, WE DON'T HAVE A STATEMENT YET FROM MICHELLE. WE DON'T
HAVE A STATEMENT FROM MARK PARTRIDGE. WE DON'T HAVE A STATEMENT FROM
HOWARD WEITZMAN. WE DON'T HAVE A STATEMENT FROM SKIP TAFT. WE DON'T HAVE
A STATEMENT FROM CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT. WE STILL DON'T HAVE DISCOVERY OF
THEM. AND IN ORDER TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY IN RESPONSE, I
NEED TO HAVE THOSE STATEMENTS.

*THE COURT:* MY RECOLLECTION IS, THAT IS A LIST OF PEOPLE WHOSE
STATEMENTS WERE BELATEDLY GIVEN TO YOU AND/OR -- YES. THOSE STATEMENTS
WERE GIVEN TO YOU, ALBEIT AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS AFTER THE FIRST DAY
OF OPENING STATEMENT BY THE DEFENSE.

*MS. CLARK:* NO, YOUR HONOR. WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A STATEMENT FOR
MICHELLE -- MARK PARTRIDGE I BELIEVE IS A ONE-PARAGRAPH REPRESENTATION
THAT HE SPOKE TO DEFENSE COUNSEL, BUT NO PARTICULARS AS TO WHAT HE SAID.
HOWARD WEITZMAN, WE HAVE NO STATEMENT. SKIP TAFT, NO STATEMENT.
CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT, NO STATEMENT. THERE'S ONLY ONE WITNESS HERE FOR
WHICH WE REALLY HAVE A STATEMENT. THAT'S MARY ANNE GERCHAS. AND WE ARE
PUTTING TOGETHER A PROFFER AS TO HER AT THIS TIME. I BELIEVE THAT MR.
DARDEN WILL BE BRINGING IT DOWN WITH HIM.

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I RESPOND TO THOSE STATEMENTS SITUATION, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* WELL, HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE, MR. COCHRAN. I JUST WANTED TO
SETTLE WHERE WE ARE AT THIS POINT. ALL RIGHT. MR. COCHRAN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES, YOUR HONOR, IF I MIGHT.

*THE COURT:* GOOD MORNING, SIR.

*MR. COCHRAN:* GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR. WE -- I JUST GOT YOUR HONOR'S
ORDER THIS MORNING, PROPOSED ORDER, AND WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT.
I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST OF ALL TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE LIST OF WITNESSES
THAT THE COURT PROPOSES TO TELL THE JURY ABOUT IN THE JURY INSTRUCTION,
WHICH I THINK IS THE HEART OF YOUR HONOR'S PROPOSED ORDER OBVIOUSLY.
WITH REGARD TO MARY ANN GERCHAS, MR. DOUGLAS HAS INDICATED THAT -- AND
OUR POSITION IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE AND ABSOLUTELY IS THAT WHEN I READ
THE NAME MARY ANN GERCHAS, I BELIEVED THAT THAT STATEMENT HAD BEEN
TURNED OVER. IT IN FACT HADN'T, AND WE INDICATED THAT. WITH REGARD TO
MICHELLE ABUDRAHM, THERE IS NO STATEMENT. WITH REGARD TO MARK PARTRIDGE,
THE PROSECUTION, YOUR HONOR, HAD IN FACT BEEN GIVEN A PORTION OF HIS
STATEMENT. IN FACT, IN A LETTER THAT HE WROTE AFTER A MEMO WHERE -- HE'S
A LAWYER AS THE COURT IS AWARE. HE RETURNED BACK TO CHICAGO IF I RECALL
-- AND I'LL TRY TO FIND THIS -- MR. PARTRIDGE WROTE A LETTER DETAILING
HIS OBSERVATIONS OF MR. SIMPSON AND SENT A COPY TO THE PROSECUTION AND
TO THE DEFENSE. MR. DOUGLAS TURNED OVER ANOTHER TWO PAGES I THINK
AFTERWARDS. THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN NOTIFIED OF MR. PARTRIDGE AND HAD AN
EARLIER STATEMENT, AND I BELIEVE THEY ALSO HAD HIS LENGTHY MEMO OF ABOUT
WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE. WITH REGARD TO HOWARD WEITZMAN, SKIP TAFT, THERE
ARE NO STATEMENTS. THESE ARE BOTH LAWYERS, AND WE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT
TO THE COURT. THERE ARE NO STATEMENTS. THERE IS NO SUBTERFUGE. THE COURT
IS AWARE OF THE RELATIONSHIP WE WOULD HAVE WITH SKIP TAFT, A BUSINESS
LAWYER THAT WE TALKED TO ON A DAILY BASIS. THERE IS NO REPORT.

*THE COURT:* WELL, THE PROBLEM, MR. COCHRAN, IS THAT NEITHER OF THESE
PERSONS APPEAR ON YOUR WITNESS LIST.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AND I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I'M SAYING THERE IS NO REPORT
REGARDING THOSE TWO. WITH REGARD TO CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT --

*THE COURT:* BUT THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT PLACED ON THE WITNESS LIST,
THERE'S NO NOTIFICATION TO THE OTHER SIDE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE
WITNESSES, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AND I UNDERSTAND AND I INDICATE TO THE COURT THAT IS
THROUGH INADVERTENCE AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR HONOR'S SANCTION ON THAT.
WITH REGARD TO CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT, THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED CHRISTIAN
RIECHARDT AT LENGTH. HE'S ON THE LIST. THEY INTERVIEWED HIM AT LENGTH
WITH DOMINIC RUBALCAVA, THE LAWYER. THERE'S A TRANSCRIPT TO THAT EFFECT
I BELIEVE AND WE HAVE NO STATEMENT, WE HAVE NO REPORT OF CHRISTIAN
RIECHARDT. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING THE COURT WITH REGARD TO RIECHARDT
-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PREJUDICE IS. WE HAVE NO REPORT. THEY
KNOW ABOUT HIM. HE'S FAY RESNICK'S FORMER FIANCE'. YOU HEARD WHAT MR.
DARDEN SAID. AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING, YOUR HONOR, HOW MR. DARDEN CAN
IMMEDIATELY MAKE SOME STATEMENT MALIGNING CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT WHEN HE
KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM OR, FOR INSTANCE, WITH REGARD TO MARY ANN
GERCHAS, WHEN THEY HEARD THE NAME, IT SEEMS THAT THEY ALREADY HAD KNOWN
ABOUT HER. AND THE COURT WILL RECALL THAT WITH REGARD TO MARY ANN
GERCHAS -- THIS IS NOT TO OBVIATE WHATEVER YOU FEEL IS PROPER. I'M
PREPARED TO GO FORWARD AND ARGUE. MARY ANN GERCHAS HAD TRIED TO CONTACT
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THE COURT SHOULD READ THAT STATEMENT.
SHE NOT ONLY TALKED TO PATTY FAIRBANKS IN THE D.A.'S OFFICE. SHE PUTS IN
THE STATEMENT IF I RECALL THE PHONE NUMBER OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE THAT SHE CALLED.

*THE COURT:* MR. COCHRAN, THOUGH, THAT'S DANCING AROUND THE ISSUE. THE
ISSUE IS, WAS THIS PERSON NAMED AS A WITNESS BY THE DEFENSE --

*MR. COCHRAN:* NO, SHE WAS NOT.

*THE COURT:* -- AND WERE THE STATEMENTS IN YOUR POSSESSION TURNED OVER
PRIOR TO TRIAL. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS NO.

*MR. COCHRAN:* SHE WAS NAMED. SHE WAS NAMED I BELIEVE AND THE STATEMENT
WAS NOT TURNED OVER AS I INDICATED TO THE COURT.

*THE COURT:* THAT'S A VIOLATION OF THE DISCOVERY ORDER.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AND I APPRECIATE THAT, YOUR HONOR. BUT I THOUGHT THE
COURT SHOULD HAVE ALL THE FACTS. AND I THINK WHAT IT DOES, IT GOES TO
THE STATE OF MIND -- OUR STATE OF MIND. YOUR HONOR -- AND IF I CAN SAY
THIS AGAIN. NO WAY IN THE WORLD -- WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE WANT TO
WITHHOLD WITNESSES FROM THEM THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY PRECLUDE DOWN THE
ROAD? WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO DAMAGE MR. SIMPSON. IN THE
EFFORT -- THIS IS A MASSIVE VOLUME OF WORK WITHOUT AN EXCUSE. WE WANT TO
GET THIS CASE UNDERWAY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO HARM THAT. WE
WANT TO TRY THE CASE. WE'RE THE ONES WHO DID NOT WAIVE TIME AND WANT TO
GET IT FORWARD. WE UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO ALL ABIDE BY THE RULES, AND WE
ACCEPT THAT. THE OTHER THING I THINK THAT THE COURT SHOULD LISTEN TO IS
THAT THIS VIOLATION -- IN THE JURY INSTRUCTION, PROPOSED JURY
INSTRUCTION, THE COURT SAID -- THE COURT PROPOSES THIS WAS VIOLATION OF
THE LAW AND THE CAUSE OF THE TWO-DAY DELAY. WELL, THAT'S NOT COMPLETELY
CORRECT BECAUSE AS YOU INDICATE LATER, PART OF THE CAUSE OF THE DELAY
WAS THE ILLNESS OF D.A. WILLIAM HODGMAN. SO I THINK THE COURT NEEDS TO
MODIFY THAT IN SOME WAY SO IT MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE FACTS. IF
THAT WAS THE ONLY CAUSE, PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE ARGUED ON FRIDAY OR
WHATEVER. SO I THINK THAT -- I WOULD ASK THE COURT TO CONSIDER THAT.
WITH REGARD TO THE EXPERTS, WE WILL COMPLY WHEREVER POSSIBLE, YOUR
HONOR. WE DO NOT HAVE REPORTS YET BECAUSE MUCH OF -- THE REASON WE DON'T
HAVE REPORTS, YOUR HONOR, IS BECAUSE OUR EXPERTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE. WE'RE MAKING A MOTION TO THAT EFFECT, TO
BE ABLE TO EXAMINE THIS EVIDENCE IN THEIR LAB THAT THEY CAN THEN MAKE
THE REPORT. WE KNOW GENERALLY FROM THEIR OBSERVATIONS WHAT THEY ARE
GOING TO SAY. AND FOR COUNSEL TO SAY THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT DRS.
BADIN AND DRS. LEE -- AND DR. LEE AND DR. WOLF WERE OUT HERE THE WEEK OF
JUNE 12TH, YOUR HONOR. THE COURT IS AWARE. THE OTHER THING, AS THE COURT
CORRECTLY POINTS OUT, IN THIS REOPENING OF THE OPENING STATEMENT, IT IS
ILLOGICAL AT BEST AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE CONFUSING AT WORSE TO
ALLOW THEM TO REOPEN TO TALK ABOUT MARY ANN GERCHAS, FROM THAT
STANDPOINT. I THINK THAT IF YOU ADMONISH THE JURY TO DISREGARD IT, THEN
THEY GET UP AND THEN TALK ABOUT HER, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, YOUR
HONOR. THEN DO I GET A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY? YOUR
HONOR, WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THIS COURTROOM IS, THEY HAVE CONTINUALLY
MALIGNED WITNESSES. AND THAT HAS AN INTIMIDATING EFFECT AND THAT IS
WRONG. SO WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DEFENSE, LET'S TALK ABOUT THEM.
OVER THIS WEEKEND, EVERY ONE OF THESE WITNESSES THAT WERE MALIGNED BY
MR. DARDEN NOW HAVE LAWYERS; MARY ANN GERCHAS, CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT, RON
FISCHMAN AND ROSA LOPEZ.

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR, I OBJECT TO THIS. NONE OF THIS IS RESPONSIVE.

*THE COURT:* HOLD ON. MISS CLARK, PLEASE.

*MS. CLARK:* NONE OF THIS IS RESPONSIVE TO THE COURT'S QUESTION.

*THE COURT:* I'M GOING TO INSTRUCT COUNSEL NOT TO INTERRUPT OTHER
COUNSEL'S STATEMENTS. THIS COURT IS MORE THAN PATIENT. I ALLOW EACH SIDE
TO COMPLETELY SAY WHAT IT IS THEY WANT TO SAY. I'M NOT GOING TO TOLERATE
ANY MORE INTERRUPTIONS BY COUNSEL FROM EITHER SIDE. THAT'S A WARNING TO
ALL COUNSEL. NEXT VIOLATION WILL BE DEALT WITH BY SANCTIONS, INCLUDING
CONTEMPT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I PROCEED YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* PLEASE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU. YOUR HONOR, WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY IS, I
THINK IT'S TOTALLY IMPROPER TO DO THOSE THINGS BECAUSE IT HAS AN EFFECT
ON THESE WITNESSES AND I THINK IT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR. NOW, WHAT THE COURT
IS GOING TO SEE IN THE COMING WEEKS, THESE LAWYERS WILL ALL BE
ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE; AND IT HAS A PRONOUNCED EFFECT WHEN A DISTRICT
ATTORNEY STANDS UP AND SAYS THAT AND DOES THAT IN OPEN COURT. AND I
THINK THAT IS GERMAINE TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND TO PROCEDURES,
YOUR HONOR. SO I WOULD JUST LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY, IF THE COURT WOULD
ALLOW US, TO RESPOND TO THE PEOPLE'S REQUEST FOR THIS REOPENING. AS I
SAID, I THINK THAT'S TOTALLY -- WOULD BE IMPROPER --

*THE COURT:* WELL, MR. COCHRAN, WHAT I ANTICIPATE DOING IS, AFTER I HEAR
THE PROSECUTION'S PROFFER AS TO WHAT IT IS THEY WOULD GO INTO AND HOW IT
IS THAT THEY WOULD APPROACH IT, THEN I'LL ALLOW YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT
TO SEE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO
FAR AGAIN IS TRIAL IN THE MEDIA. WHAT WE SAW IN COURT HERE, TO HAVE A
WITNESS WHO'S NEVER BEEN BEFORE THIS COURT, I PRESUME BRANDED AS A
CERTIFIED PATHOLOGICAL LIAR, YOUR HONOR, THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS. AND IF NOT
-- WOULD NOT BE DONE EXCEPT UNDER THE AEGIS OF SOME KIND OF QUALIFIED
IMMUNITY HERE IN COURT. AND I THINK THAT'S UNFAIR. AND THE WITNESS THEN
OBVIOUSLY HAD A GREAT EFFECT UPON HER. AND WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE DOES
THAT SEND OUT TO OTHER WITNESSES, YOUR HONOR? FURTHERMORE, ALL THE
THINGS THAT WERE INTRODUCED, YOUR HONOR, THE THINGS THAT WERE INTRODUCED
WOULD PROBABLY NOT EVEN BE ADMISSIBLE FROM A STANDPOINT OF ATTACKING
THIS LADY'S CREDIBILITY. SHE HAS SOME CIVIL LAWSUITS, HOW IS THAT
RELEVANT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT ON JUNE 12TH OF 1994 AT ABOUT 10:45 IN THE
EVENING, SHE SAW FOUR MEN RUNNING FROM THE VICINITY OF 875 SOUTH BUNDY?
THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY THE ISSUE, YOUR HONOR, ISN'T IT?

*THE COURT:* ABSOLUTELY.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THAT'S THE ISSUE. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE OTHER
THINGS THAT HAPPENED SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE I'M
JUST SAYING TO THE COURT THAT THIS IS HAVING A PRONOUNCED EFFECT, AND I
KNOW THAT BECAUSE I'M BEING CONTACTED BY THESE PEOPLE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MR. COCHRAN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. YOUR HONOR, MAYBE I SHOULD SAY ONE
OTHER THING. AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE 1, I THINK IT WAS CLEAR, AS WE
INDICATED TO THE COURT, THE OTHER WITNESSES THAT WERE TURNED OVER --
BECAUSE THE COURT HAD ORDERED MR. DOUGLAS TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION,
AND WE SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE DID EXACTLY AS YOU HAD ASKED AND
MAKE IT CLEAR ALSO THAT THIS HAS NOT BEEN HIS RESPONSIBILITY PRIOR TO
JANUARY 2ND OF 1995.

*THE COURT:* OH, I THINK THE RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. MR. DOUGLAS DID
INDICATE THAT THAT WAS HIS RESPONSIBILITY AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES. AND HE TOOK IT OVER. AND OF THAT LIST, OF THE TOTAL
LIST THAT WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT, YOUR HONOR -- AND WE DISPUTE MARK
PARTRIDGE BECAUSE WE THINK THEY DID KNOW HIM AND HAD A STATEMENT FROM
HIM -- THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE BASICALLY MENTIONED IN THE OPENING
STATEMENT WERE MARY ANNE GERCHAS AND MICHELLE ABUDRAHM, AND APPARENTLY
THERE IS NO REPORT THAT WE HAVE ON MICHELLE. YOUR HONOR -- AND THE OTHER
THING THAT ALSO COMES TO MIND, MR. DOUGLAS REMINDS ME IS, THE COURT WILL
RECALL THAT IN ONE OF HIS DIATRIBES, MR. DARDEN STOOD UP AND SAID, IF
RON FISCHMAN TELLS THE TRUTH, HE'LL SAY THAT O.J. SIMPSON MADE A
STATEMENT ABOUT GETTING SOMEBODY. NOW, YOUR HONOR, WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANY
REPORT LIKE THAT. WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANY SUCH STATEMENT. SO WHEN HE MAKES
THOSE KINDS OF STATEMENTS OR WHEN HE IMMEDIATELY HE KNOWS ABOUT MARY
ANNE GERCHAS -- AND ANOTHER STATEMENT HE SAYS, IF YOU RECALL, IF MR.
COCHRAN HAD ASKED ME, I WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS WITNESS OR THESE
WITNESSES. HOW DOES HE KNOW THOSE THINGS, YOUR HONOR, IMMEDIATELY IF HE
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THESE WITNESSES? I THINK THE COURT IN BEING
EVEN-HANDED, WHICH YOU ARE, WOULD WANT TO INQUIRE ABOUT THAT.

*THE COURT:* WELL, I'VE ALREADY SANCTIONED THE PROSECUTION SEVERELY FOR
THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS IN THE DISCOVERY PROCESS. AND THIS SANCTION
PROCEEDING PROCESS I SUSPECT WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT AFTER TODAY, YOUR HONOR. IT WILL NOT
-- IT WON'T BE NECESSARY. BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I'M SAYING, HOW
WOULD HE THEN BE IN A POSITION TO GIVE ME ADVICE ABOUT WITNESSES IF HE
HAD KNOWN OR TO KNOW -- HAVE A STATEMENT ABOUT RON FISCHMAN IF HE DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT RON FISCHMAN? I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT AND I DON'T THINK IT
MAKES SENSE. SO I WOULD ASK THE COURT TO INQUIRE ABOUT THAT. TO CONCLUDE
MY POINT THOUGH, OTHER WITNESSES THAT YOU ASKED MR. DOUGLAS TO PROFFER
FOR THE COURT, WE DID THAT. AS MR. DOUGLAS HAS INDICATED, MANY OF THESE
WITNESSES WERE OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, PROBABLY NEVER BE CALLED.
BUT SECONDLY, THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND WE'VE DONE THAT.
BUT NONE OF THOSE -- ALMOST NONE OF THOSE WITNESSES WERE MENTIONED IN
THE OPENING STATEMENT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GERCHAS AND MICHELLE
ABUDRAHM, AS I SAID, REFERRING TO THE LIST AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE 1, YOUR
HONOR.

*THE COURT:* WELL, YOU DID MENTION GERCHAS, ABUDRAHM, PARTRIDGE,
WEITZMAN, TAFT AND RIECHARDT IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS.

*MR. COCHRAN:* RIGHT. I WAS REFERRING TO THE LIST AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE
1. AND I DID IN FACT MENTION THE OTHERS. AND AS I SAID, THERE ARE NO
REPORTS, BUT I DID IN FACT MENTION THEM. BUT I THINK AGAIN, YOUR HONOR,
THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW -- THE PROSECUTION, YOUR HONOR, KNOWS ABOUT HOWARD
WEITZMAN AND SKIP TAFT BECAUSE THEY WERE DOWN THERE WITH MR. SIMPSON AT
THE TIME HE GAVE A STATEMENT. NOW, WE DON'T HAVE A STATEMENT AND IT WAS
AN OVERSIGHT AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT ON THE LIST. THESE ARE TWO
LAWYERS. NOW, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THE COURT IS GOING TO SHOOT ME
OVER THAT. I MEAN I THINK THAT -- YOU MAY WANT TO.

*THE COURT:* DON'T TEMPT ME.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I DON'T THINK YOU ARE GOING TO SHOOT ME OVER THAT. AND
CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT, YOUR HONOR, THEY KNOW ABOUT -- THEY EVEN
INTERVIEWED HIM. THEY KNOW THAT'S FAY RESNICK'S BOYFRIEND. AND I THINK,
AS I SAID, WITH MARK PARTRIDGE, THEY HAD A STATEMENT ON HIM. SO I THINK
THE COURT SHOULD LISTEN TO US. I WOULD LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND
SPECIFICALLY WHEN THEY'RE READY. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED, YOUR
HONOR. LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING, THE COURT CAN GIVE THESE PROPOSED
SANCTIONS, AND YOU'VE DONE THAT FOR THE PROSECUTION. I MEAN IT SHOULD BE
CLEAR THEY WERE SANCTIONED, AND YOU DID THAT, AND NOW YOU IMPOSE
SANCTIONS UPON US. WE WILL PROCEED WITH THOSE. I THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE
SOME ADJUSTMENT IN THE ORDER REGARDING THE DELAY. I THINK IT'S NOT FAIR
TO SAY IT'S ONLY THE DEFENSE. BUT WE'RE THEN READY TO PROCEED, YOUR
HONOR, AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PROCEED THIS MORNING. KEEP IN
MIND, IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SANCTIONS, HOW UNFAIR IT IS TO MR. O.J.
SIMPSON, THAT, NUMBER ONE, THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS, I COULDN'T RESPOND
IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE PROSECUTORS WERE FINISHED ON TUESDAY. THE COURT
DECLARED A RECESS. ON WEDNESDAY, I WAS ABLE TO START RESPONDING, AND WE
HAD ALL THESE OBJECTIONS FROM THE PROSECUTION. THEN MR. HODGMAN GETS
SICK. AND THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, WE'VE BEEN OFF. THE COURT SAYS BE READY
AT 9:00 O'CLOCK. WE COME IN, WE GET THE ORDER ABOUT 8:30. WE'RE READY,
READY AGAIN. I'VE BEEN READY FOR ABOUT NOW 10 DAYS TO GIVE THIS OPENING
STATEMENT. NOW THE PROSECUTOR SAYS, GEE, JUDGE, WE NEED NOW UNTIL 1:30.
I MEAN SOMETIME, AT SOME TIME, I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COMPLETE THE
OPENING STATEMENT, JUDGE. AND I THINK THAT THAT ALSO HAS TAKEN THE FORM
OF A SANCTION AND I THINK IT'S A SANCTION THAT IS NOT ONLY UPON THE
DEFENSE, BUT DIRECTLY UPON MR. SIMPSON, AND I WOULD ASK THE COURT TO
ALLOW US TO GO FORWARD AT THIS POINT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MR. COCHRAN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK. I THINK WHAT I'M MOST INTERESTED IN IS HEARING
WHAT YOUR CONTEMPLATION IS OF YOUR PROFFER REGARDING THE REOPENING OF
OPENING STATEMENT.

*MS. CLARK:* WHAT DO WE CONTEMPLATE DOING?

*THE COURT:* YEAH.

*MS. CLARK:* WE HAVE AMASSED INFORMATION ON SEVERAL OF THE WITNESSES
MENTIONED BY MR. COCHRAN THAT ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND PRECISELY WHY HE
HID THEM THE WAY HE DID, AND WE ARE GOING TO PREPARE THOSE REMARKS FOR
THE COURT. WE HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLING THAT INFORMATION OVER THE WEEKEND,
AND NOW THAT WE'RE FINALLY IN POSSESSION OF THE COURT'S RULING, WE WILL
ADDRESS WHAT THE COURT ASKED US TO ADDRESS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT
THAT TOGETHER IN A FORM THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO SUCCINCTLY STATE FOR THE
COURT WHAT THE POINTS ARE THAT WE INTEND TO ADDRESS WITH EACH WITNESS. I
WOULD SIMPLY INDICATE THAT THE STATEMENT TAKEN FROM MARY ANNE GERCHAS
MOST RECENTLY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT COUNSEL, COUNSEL ALONE WAS IN
POSSESSION OF HER STATEMENT, THAT SHE ASKED COUNSEL TO TURN HER
STATEMENT OVER TO THE PROSECUTION AND COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE NEVER DID.
SHE INDICATES VERY SPECIFICALLY THAT SHE SPOKE TO MR. HOSTETLER, WHO WE
KNEW TO BE ONE OF THE INVESTIGATORS FOR THE DEFENSE, AND SHE TOLD HIM
THAT SHE WANTED THEM TO TURN THE STATEMENT OVER TO US. SO EVEN THE
WITNESSES ASKED TO DO THAT AND DEFENSE WILLFULLY REFUSED TO DO SO.

*THE COURT:* WELL, MISS CLARK, YOU ARE ARGUING AN ISSUE AND RULING THAT
THE COURT HAS ALREADY MADE. I'VE ALREADY MADE A FINDING ADVERSE TO THE
DEFENSE. I'VE GRANTED A LARGE NUMBER OF THE SANCTIONS THAT YOU'VE
REQUESTED. I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT THE JURY THAT A TRANSGRESSION OF THE
LAW OF DISCOVERY HAS OCCURRED AND HAS BEEN PART OF THE CAUSE OF THE
DELAY. SO TO ARGUE THE BASIS FOR THE COURT'S RULING AT THIS POINT
DOESN'T HELP ME A LOT. WHAT I NEED TO KNOW IS, ASSUMING I AM WILLING TO
ALLOW YOU TO REOPEN, SINCE THIS IS A HIGHLY UNUSUAL REMEDY THAT YOU
ASKED FOR AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE CIVIL CASE THAT DEALS WITH
THAT -- I HAVE NEVER SEEN A CASE ALLOWING REOPENING AFTER A DISCOVERY
SANCTION HAS BEEN PROPOSED.

*MS. CLARK:* WHEN HAS THE COURT SEEN AN ABUSE -- BUT WHEN HAS THE COURT
SEEN A VIOLATION THIS SEVERE?

*THE COURT:* YOU ARE ARGUING -- I'VE ALREADY RULED IN YOUR FAVOR, MISS
CLARK. YOU DON'T NEED TO TELL ME HOW SEVERE IT IS. YOU DON'T NEED TO
TELL ME WHAT THE BASIS IS. I THINK THE RULING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

*MS. CLARK:* IT DOES.

*THE COURT:* ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE COURT'S FINDING AS TO
INTENT AND TACTICAL ADVANTAGE, WHICH IS AS HARSH A FINDING THAT THE
COURT CAN MAKE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, IF I
GRANT YOUR MOTION TO REOPEN, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY TO THE JURY?
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

*MS. CLARK:* AND I'VE ASKED LEAVE OF THE COURT TO --

*THE COURT:* AND WHAT I WOULD ANTICIPATE YOU ARE GOING TO SAY IS THAT
YOU ARE GOING TO TELL THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF OUR JURY, HAD THE
PROSECUTION KNOWN OF THESE PERSONS, WE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THEM,
X, Y AND Z, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PROVE. I THINK THAT'S ABOUT
THE MAXIMUM PERIMETER THAT I WOULD ENTERTAIN, AND I STRESS THE WORD
"ENTERTAIN". ALL RIGHT. AT THIS POINT THEN, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE
PROCEED THEN WITH THE CONCLUSION OF MR. COCHRAN'S OPENING REMARKS. AND
THAT AFTER THE LUNCH HOUR, YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK
AND ASK ME TO REOPEN, AND I'LL RULE AT THAT TIME BASED UPON YOUR PROFFER
AFTER I HEAR MR. COCHRAN'S OBJECTIONS. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT SO WE CAN
MAKE GOOD USE OF THE COURT TIME SINCE WE HAVE OUR JURORS SEATED READY,
WILLING, ABLE TO GO. YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THAT WITH MR. DARDEN FOR A MOMENT?

*MS. CLARK:* MAY I ADDRESS THE COURT FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPERT
WITNESSES?

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY.

*MS. CLARK:* MR. COCHRAN INDICATED JUST NOW THAT SOME OF THE EXPERTS
HAVE NOT EVEN EXAMINED THE EVIDENCE, AND I FIND IT INCREDIBLE THAT ANY
OFFICER OF THE COURT COULD STAND BEFORE A JURY AND REPRESENT WHAT
CONCLUSIONS AND FINDINGS HAVE BEEN MADE WHEN THE EXPERTS HAVE NOT EVEN
CONDUCTED AN EXAMINATION. THAT ASSERTION THAT THEY HAVE NOT EVEN
EXAMINED THE EVIDENCE IS INCREDIBLE TO ME. IF THAT IS THE CASE, AND HE'S
MADE REPRESENTATIONS AS TO WHAT THEIR FINDINGS ARE, I THINK THAT THERE'S
A GREAT DEAL OF CREDIBILITY LOST WITH RESPECT TO THOSE WITNESSES.
OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO BE A BOOTSTRAP CONCLUSION. COUNSEL, WHO IS NOT
AN EXPERT, CAN STAND UP AND TELL THIS JURY BEFORE AN EXAMINATION OF
EVIDENCE IS CONDUCTED WHAT THE RESULT WILL BE, I FIND THAT REMARKABLE,
AND I THINK THE JURY SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THAT FACT. I THINK THEY
SHOULD BE TOLD, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK, THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT, BUT I DON'T KNOW
THE FULL PERIMETERS OF WHAT IT IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNTIL THE
DISCLOSURES OF EXPERT WITNESS LISTS HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AS I ORDERED
TODAY. I CAN ALWAYS REINSTRUCT AND READMONISH THE JURY AT ANY TIME
DURING THE COURSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. YOU CAN ALSO BRING UP DURING THE
COURSE OF YOUR CLOSING ARGUMENT THAT CONTRADICTION.

*MS. CLARK:* I AM AWARE OF THAT, YOUR HONOR. BUT THAT DOESN'T ADDRESS
THE HARM THAT'S ALREADY BEEN CAUSED IN THAT COUNSEL HAS INDICATED TO THE
JURY CERTAIN EXPERTS EXIST WHO WILL TESTIFY TO THE FOLLOWING, AND WE HAD
NO KNOWLEDGE AND NO PRIOR DISCOVERY OF ANY -- NOT EVEN THEIR NAMES. ONLY
THIS MORNING, BECAUSE THE COURT INDICATED IT HAD A SUSPICION ABOUT WHO
THAT WAS, DID WE FIND OUT WHO THAT WAS. NOW HE TELLS US --

*THE COURT:* WELL, IT'S NOT A SUSPICION. IT'S JUST A LOGICAL CONCLUSION
FROM WHAT WE ALREADY ALL KNOW ABOUT THE CASE.

*MS. CLARK:* OKAY. BUT THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH ANY DISCOVERY LAW THAT
I AM AWARE OF.

*THE COURT:* THIS IS TRUE.

*MS. CLARK:* SO COUNSEL IS INDICATING NOW THAT HE IS GOING TO TESTIFY TO
TIRE TRACKS AND TO SHOE PRINTS THAT WERE FOUND AT BUNDY, WE HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO REPORT, NO KNOWLEDGE AND NO INFORMATION THAT ANY SUCH
TESTIMONY WOULD BE FORTHCOMING. THOSE SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE
DISCOVERY SANCTIONS AS WELL. WITH RESPECT TO LENORE WALKER, I'M
PARTICULARLY SURPRISED AND DISMAYED AT WHAT COUNSEL HAS REPRESENTED TO
THIS COURT. COUNSEL REPRESENTED TO THIS COURT WHEN LAST WE WERE HERE
THAT LENORE WALKER WAS ONLY ADDED TO -- WAS ONLY CONTACTED FOR THE
PURPOSE OF TESTIFYING IN THIS MATTER IN JANUARY, WHAT, JUST A FEW DAYS
BEFORE THE DISCOVERY HEARINGS OCCURRED. THAT'S FALSE. IT WAS STATED IN
THE LOS ANGELES TIMES BY DR. LENORE WALKER HERSELF THAT SHE WAS RETAINED
BY COUNSEL IN THE SUMMER OF '94 AND THAT SHE HAS SPOKEN TO THE DEFENDANT
FOR HOURS IN PREPARATION FOR HER TESTIMONY. SO THE VIOLATION IS EVEN
MORE FLAGRANT WITH RESPECT TO HER. AT LEAST THAT'S ACCORDING TO WHAT SHE
SAID TO THE L.A. TIMES. SO COUNSEL HAS -- IS NOW CONTINUING TO
PERPETRATE A FRAUD UPON THIS COURT, IS CONTINUING TO MAKE
MISREPRESENTATIONS CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE WITNESSES THAT THEY HAVE
CONTACTED AND THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASE. HE IS STILL WITHHOLDING
MORE INFORMATION. THERE ARE WITNESSES WHOSE NAMES WE STILL DON'T HAVE,
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE NO REPORTS. THAT'S A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF THE
LAW. AND NOW IT'S COMPOUNDED BY COUNSEL'S WILLFUL ASSERTIONS TO THE
CONTRARY WHERE THE WITNESSES ARE TELLING US IN TERMS OF WHEN THEY WERE
RETAINED. HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG? THE JURY SHOULD
BE TOLD ALL OF THIS.

*THE COURT:* TELL ME ABOUT THE L.A. TIMES INFORMATION ABOUT LENORE WALKER.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT'S AN ARTICLE IN THE L.A. TIMES TODAY I UNDERSTAND OR
YESTERDAY. WAS IT YESTERDAY OR TODAY?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* I HAVE IT UPSTAIRS. I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE SUNDAY TIMES,
YOUR HONOR. AND IF THE COURT WOULD LIKE, I COULD HAVE IT BROUGHT DOWN.

*THE COURT:* I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT.

*MS. CLARK:* I WILL.

*THE COURT:* BUT BEFORE WE -- MR. COCHRAN, YOU INDICATED A DESIRE TO
ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE?

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I THINK I READ THE ARTICLE. AND WHAT IT INDICATED --
FIRST OF ALL, IT SAID, IF I RECALL, DR. LENORE WALKER HAD KNOWN ME SINCE
THE TIME I WAS ASSISTANT D.A. AND WORKED IN THIS OFFICE, IN THE D.A.'S
OFFICE, THAT I HAD -- SHE AND GERALDINE BUTTS STAHLY HAD WORKED ON CASES
THAT I HAD THE BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME AS A DEFENSE IN OTHER MURDER
CASES. I THINK IT ALSO INDICATED THAT SHE WAS CONTACTED I BELIEVE IN
DECEMBER, BUT SHE WAS NOT RETAINED OR BROUGHT FORWARD ON THIS CASE, YOUR
HONOR, UNTIL AFTER YOU RULED ON THE DOMESTIC DISCORD. IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY
SENSE. WE DIDN'T NEED HER UNTIL THAT POINT. WE DON'T HAVE A REPORT. IF
THE COURT CHECKS YOUR HONOR'S RECORDS WHEN WE MADE AN APPLICATION FOR
LENORE WALKER TO GO INTO THE JAIL TO SEE MR. SIMPSON ALONG WITH
GERALDINE BUTTS STAHLY, WHO SAW HIM -- HAS NOT EVEN CONCLUDED -- SAW HIM
AS LATE AS THIS PAST FRIDAY -- THE COURT WILL KNOW THE TIME SHE WENT TO
SEE HIM. WE DON'T HAVE A REPORT AND SHE CAME ABOUT -- SHE IS ONLY
RELEVANT, YOUR HONOR, AFTER YOU RULED ON THE DOMESTIC DISCORD. I'VE
KNOWN HER FOR SOME TIME, BUT SHE WAS NOT RELEVANT IN THIS CASE UNTIL
THAT TIME. SO I THINK -- I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY -- SHE HAS PROBABLY
TALKED TO -- I CALLED FIRST TIME IN THE FALL, BUT SHE DIDN'T GET
INVOLVED IN THE CASE UNTIL AFTER THE DOMESTIC DISCORD. I KNEW HER EVER
SINCE 19 -- SINCE THE 80'S.

*MS. CLARK:* I DON'T THINK --

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS CLARK, LET ME ASK YOUR STAFF TO BRING DOWN
THE L.A. TIMES ARTICLE, ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY THAT SOURCE IS HEARSAY.

*MS. CLARK:* IT'S RIGHT FROM THE WITNESS' MOUTH, YOUR HONOR. LET ME ALSO
INDICATE THAT WITH RESPECT TO MARY ANN GERCHAS, IN HER STATEMENT TO US
TAKEN MOST RECENTLY AFTER COUNSEL'S OPENING STATEMENT, SHE INDICATES
THAT SHE TURNED OVER HER DAILY RUNNER, THAT'S A DAILY CALENDAR, TO COUNSEL.

*THE COURT:* I KNOW WHAT A DAILY RUNNER IS.

*MS. CLARK:* OKAY. AND THAT HAS NEVER BEEN TURNED OVER TO US. IN FACT,
IT WAS NEVER EVEN MENTIONED THAT THEY HAD IT. SHE INDICATES THAT SHE
TURNED IT OVER TO THEM AND THEY HAVE NEVER TURNED IT OVER.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WELL, I CAN SEE THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ON-GOING
PROCEDURE HERE. MISS CLARK, HOWEVER, I THINK MY SUGGESTION, THAT AFTER
THE DEFENSE HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT'S ORDER
REGARDING EXPERT WITNESSES, WE CAN REVISIT THE MATTER AGAIN, AND I CAN
STILL REINSTRUCT THE JURY AT ANY TIME DURING THE COURSE OF THESE
PROCEEDINGS REGARDING DISCOVERY VIOLATIONS.

*MS. CLARK:* THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN OUR PROFFER TO REOPEN, WE WOULD LIKE
TO INCLUDE THOSE EXPERT WITNESSES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WELL, WHEN I HEAR THE PROFFER, I'LL RULE ON IT.
BUT MY INCLINATION THIS MORNING IS TO GO FORWARD WITH THE JURY, HAVE MR.
COCHRAN COMPLETE HIS OPENING STATEMENTS, THEN I'LL HEAR YOUR PROFFER AND
WE'LL SEE WHERE WE ARE. ALL RIGHT?

*MS. CLARK:* CAN WE AT LEAST HAVE THE DEFENSE GIVE US THE NAMES OF THE
WITNESSES THEY INTEND TO CALL AS TO THE MATTERS I DESCRIBED, THE TIRE
TRACKS, THE SHOE PRINTS, THE FINGER CUT, THE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, THOSE
MATTERS?

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A CLEAR INTENT TO CALL
THESE PERSONS AS WITNESSES. SO I THINK THEIR IDENTITY NEEDS TO BE
DISCLOSED OR SHOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN DISCLOSED. MR. COCHRAN? I AGREE
THAT HER REQUEST IS WELL TAKEN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* CERTAINLY, YOUR HONOR. WE WILL PREPARE THAT, YOUR HONOR,
IF YOU GIVE US A FEW MINUTES.

*THE COURT:* WELL, WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE A 20-MINUTE BREAK JUST TO BRING
THE JURY DOWN IN ANY EVENT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* SURE.

*THE COURT:* SO YOU AND MR. DOUGLAS CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT IN THAT 20 MINUTES.

*MR. DARDEN:* YOUR HONOR, BEFORE WE GO OFF THE RECORD, CAN I HAVE A
WITNESS ORDERED BACK?

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY.

*MR. DARDEN:* CORA FISCHMAN.

*THE COURT:* AND, MR. DARDEN, WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE MISS FISCHMAN WILL
BE NECESSARY?

*MR. DARDEN:* FEBRUARY 9, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ARE YOU CORA FISCHMAN?

MS. FISCHMAN: YES.

*THE COURT:* GOOD MORNING, MISS FISCHMAN.

MS. FISCHMAN: GOOD MORNING.

*THE COURT:* I'M GOING TO ORDER YOU TO RETURN TO THIS COURTROOM ON
THURSDAY, FEBRUARY THE 9TH, AT 9:00 A.M. WITHOUT FURTHER ORDER, NOTICE
OR SUBPOENA. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE ORDER, MA'AM?

MR. RUBIN: YES, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, YOUR APPEARANCE FOR THE RECORD?

MR. RUBIN: YES. ANDREW RUBIN. I WILL REPRESENTING MISS FISCHMAN.

*THE COURT:* GOOD MORNING, COUNSEL. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

MR. RUBIN: GOOD TO SEE YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

MR. RUBIN: THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* ONE OF HIS CLIENTS NAMED A CAT AFTER ME. MS. CLARK.

*MS. CLARK:* DID THE COURT INDICATE IT WANTED TO TAKE A RECESS? I WOULD
LIKE TO HEAR THE NAMES.

*THE COURT:* MR. COCHRAN INDICATED HE AND MR. DOUGLAS WERE GOING TO
CONFIRM AND PREPARE A LIST FOR YOU IN THE 20 MINUTES THAT IT TAKES TO
BRING THE JURY DOWN. ALL RIGHT. LET'S HAVE THE JURY, DEPUTY MAGNERA.
THANK YOU.

(RECESS.)

(PAGES 12144 THROUGH 12166, VOLUME 77A, TRANSCRIBED AND SEALED UNDER
SEPARATE COVER.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. ALL
THE PARTIES ARE PRESENT. MR. DOUGLAS, YOU HAD SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO
SAY BEFORE WE START?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* I WOULD, YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOUR HONOR, IN
ADDITION TO THE COMMENTS AND TO THE OBJECTIONS THAT WE LODGED WITH THE
COURT IN CHAMBERS, I WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE POINT THAT WAS JUST
BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION RECENTLY, AND THAT IS, YOUR HONOR, OUR REVIEW
OF SECTION 1054.5(B) DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZE A JUDGE TO INSTRUCT
THE JURY THAT A DISCOVERY VIOLATION BY DEFENSE COUNSEL, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY
BE CONSIDERED BY THE JURY BEARING ON THE CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES. AND I
THINK THAT THERE IS THE DANGER THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSED
INSTRUCTION BY THE COURT GIVES SUCH A SUGGESTION, NOR DOES CASE LAW,
YOUR HONOR, AUTHORIZE SUCH A JURY INSTRUCTION. INDEED, WE SUBMIT THAT IT
WOULD BE COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL TO MAKE A CONNECTION BETWEEN A LAWYER'S
DISCOVERY OBLIGATIONS AND THE CREDIBILITY OF AN INDEPENDENT WITNESS. I
THINK, YOUR HONOR, THAT THERE IS A DANGER BY SUCH A NEXUS TRIGGERING
PROFOUND STATE AND FEDERAL VIOLATIONS, BOTH DUE PROCESS AND OF A SIXTH
AMENDMENT NATURE. AND I WOULD URGE THE COURT TO STRIKE THAT CONNECTION
IN THE COURT'S RULING. SECONDARILY, YOUR HONOR, I RESPECT -- THOUGH I
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE COURT'S FINDING THAT THE VIOLATION TO
TURN OVER THE WITNESS STATEMENTS OF MISS GERCHAS WAS INTENTIONAL. I
SUGGEST THAT THE -- THAT BEFORE THE COURT CAN PROPERLY MAKE SUCH A
RULING, THAT IS, THAT THERE WAS AN INTENTIONAL VIOLATION TO GAIN
TACTICAL ADVANTAGE, THAT THE COURT SHOULD MOST PROPERLY CONSIDER THAT
ASPECT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A SWORN DECLARATION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT MYSELF TO THIS COURT SO THAT THE COURT
COULD THEN HAVE FACTS UPON WHICH THE COURT MIGHT MAKE SUCH A FINDING IF
THE COURT IS RULING THAT A VIOLATION IS BEING IMPOSED AND A SANCTION IS
BEING IMPOSED BASED ON THE COURT'S BELIEF THAT THERE WAS AN INTENTIONAL
VIOLATION RATHER THAN AN INADVERTENT ACCIDENT AS WE CONTEND.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. DOUGLAS, I WILL GIVE YOU LEAVE TO FILE
WHATEVER AFFIDAVIT YOU WISH; HOWEVER, THE COURT'S RULING WILL STAND AND
THE COURT'S FINDING STANDS.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* VERY WELL.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU. MISS CLARK, YOU ARE STANDING FOR A REASON?

*MS. CLARK:* NO. I SUBMITTED THE ARTICLE TO THE COURT OF DR. WALKER.

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MS. CLARK:* I HAVE ALSO BEEN INFORMED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT SHE WAS ON
-- EXCUSE ME -- I HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT SHE WAS ON
GOOD MORNING AMERICA THIS MORNING INDICATING THAT SHE HAD SOME
FORTY-HOUR INTERVIEWS WITH MR. SIMPSON. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT MR.
SIMPSON IS IN COURT MOST OF THE DAY EVERY DAY, THAT WOULD PRECLUDE HER
PHYSICAL CAPABILITY OF HAVING AMASSED THAT NUMBER OF HOURS, UNLESS SHE
HAD BEEN RETAINED QUITE A LONG TIME AGO, AND ALL OF THIS FLIES IN THE
FACE OF COUNSEL'S DIRECT ASSERTIONS TO THE COURT THAT SHE HAD RECENTLY
BEEN RETAINED. IT HAS NOW BEEN EXPOSED TO BE AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD AND I
THINK THE ARTICLE AS WELL IN THE L.A. TIMES MAKES THAT CLEAR ALSO, THAT
SHE WAS ACTUALLY CONTACTED THROUGH GERALDINE STAHLY IN THE SUMMER, WHICH
THEN MAKES IT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE TO HAVE AMASSED THAT NUMBER OF HOURS.
SO I THINK THAT WHAT THE COURT HAS BEFORE IT IS FURTHER IMPEACHMENT OF
DEFENSE COUNSEL'S MOST RECENT ASSERTIONS EVEN OF HAVING BEEN RECENTLY
RETAINED.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK, I HAVE BEFORE ME A PHOTOCOPY OF A PRESS RELEASE
THAT MISS WALKER RELEASED ON -- EXCUSE ME -- DR. WALKER RELEASED JANUARY
26TH, AND THE PARAGRAPH, THE ENDING PARAGRAPH READS AS FOLLOWS:

"AS WE BEGAN TO EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS, WHICH
INCLUDED SOME FORTY HOURS OF EVALUATION OF O.J. SIMPSON, WE REALIZED
THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR LONG-TERM HARM TO BATTERED WOMAN WAS PRESENT IF
THE FACT PATTERNS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF BATTERING IN THIS CASE WERE
MISINTERPRETED, DISTORTED OR OTHERWISE MISUSED BY EITHER SIDE." SO THE
FACT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXAMINING THE EVIDENCE FOR THE PAST FIVE MONTHS
I THINK IN FACT SUPPORTS YOUR POSITION THAT IN FACT THERE WAS A
RELATIONSHIP PRIOR TO JUST LAST WEEK. HOWEVER, HAVING SAID THAT, THE
DEFENSE WAS NOT IN A POSTURE TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT TESTIMONY BY DR.
WALKER WOULD BE RELEVANT UNTIL THE COURT RULED ON THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
ISSUES, AT WHICH POINT THE COURT, HAVING ALLOWED TESTIMONY OF SOME
INCIDENTS AND HAVING EXCLUDED TESTIMONY AS TO OTHERS, THEN CLEARLY SET
THE ISSUE BEFORE THE JURY. SO I ACCEPT MR. COCHRAN'S REPRESENTATION THAT
HE DID NOT FORMALLY MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT TO CALL DR.
WALKER UNTIL AFTER THE COURT'S RULING ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, BUT THAT
ALSO CAUSES ME TO BELIEVE THAT IF THERE HAS BEEN FIVE MONTHS OF
PREPARATION, THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME NOTES AROUND.

*MS. CLARK:* EXACTLY, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* AS I INDICATED TO YOU, WE WILL TAKE UP THE ISSUE OF EXPERTS
AFTER YOU HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE LIST THAT WAS GIVEN TO
YOU IN CHAMBERS THIS MORNING BY COUNSEL.

*MS. CLARK:* AS I RECALL, MR. COCHRAN'S REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT,
WHEN LAST WE CONFRONTED THIS ISSUE, MY UNDERSTANDING WAS, AND I'M SURE
THE TRANSCRIPT WILL ALLAY ANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE ABOUT THIS, WILL RESOLVE
THOSE QUESTIONS, I BELIEVE THE REPRESENTATION MADE WAS THAT SHE HAD NOT
BEEN CONTACTED UNTIL EARLIER THAT WEEK.

*THE COURT:* WELL, COUNSEL, WE WILL GO BACK AND LOOK AT THIS AGAIN. WE
HAVE ARGUED IT ENOUGH I THINK. THE RECORD IS CLEAR WHAT IS THERE. I WILL
HAVE MY STAFF GO BACK THROUGH THE TRANSCRIPT AND SEE WHAT'S THERE, BUT I
THINK MY OBSERVATION AS TO WHAT OCCURRED HERE IS PROBABLY ACCURATE.

*MS. CLARK:* THE COURT WAS NOT LEFT WITH THE IMPRESSION BY MR. COCHRAN
THAT HE HAD JUST RECENTLY CONTACTED HER?

*THE COURT:* NO. I'M SAYING I ACCEPT MR. COCHRAN'S EXPLANATION THAT A
FORMAL DECISION TO CALL HER AS A WITNESS WAS NOT MADE UNTIL AFTER THE
COURT RULED ON THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES. I ACCEPT THAT AS BEING A
REASONABLE EXPLANATION. ALL RIGHT. BUT THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE
OUGHT TO BE SOME REPORTS BACK THERE, I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT IS AN ISSUE
THAT WE WILL ADDRESS LATER, AS I INDICATED TO YOU.

*MS. CLARK:* VERY WELL.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU.

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I SAY ONE THING? WHILE YOU ARE ADDRESSING THAT, WOULD
YOU ALSO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT DR. WALKER COULD NOT GET INTO THE JAIL
WITHOUT YOUR ORDERS AND SHE NEVER SAW MR. SIMPSON UNTIL YOU DID THE ORDER.

*THE COURT:* MR. COCHRAN, I AM AWARE OF ALL THOSE THINGS AS WELL.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THE ORDERS WERE LIKE IN DECEMBER AND AFTER. YOU KNOW WHEN
SHE SAW HIM. SHE SAW HIM WHEN HE WAS NOT IN COURT.

*THE COURT:* IT SEEMS TO ME YOU ARE AHEAD ON THIS ONE, MR. COCHRAN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I WAS, BUT I WANTED YOU TO LOOK AT THAT. THANK YOU, YOUR
HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. IN CHAMBERS, THE RECORD SHOULD REFLECT, THAT
COUNSEL DID SUGGEST TO ME THAT I INCLUDE IN MY ADMONITION TO THE JURY,
MY INSTRUCTION TO THE JURY, SOME LANGUAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE FAILURE
OF THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW OF DISCOVERY IS NOT
EVIDENCE OF THE DEFENDANT'S GUILT AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS SUCH.
I THINK THAT IS A GOOD SUGGESTION AND I WILL INCLUDE THAT IN THE
INSTRUCTION TO THE JURY, BECAUSE THAT IS IN FACT THE STATE OF THE LAW.
ALL RIGHT. DEPUTY MAGNERA, LET'S HAVE THE JURORS, PLEASE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* DID YOUR HONOR MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THE SANCTIONS?

*THE COURT:* I MADE A DECISION. YES, I DID. I INDICATED I WOULD NOT DO
THAT.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* YOUR HONOR, THE CREDIBILITY LANGUAGE IS GOING TO REMAIN?

*THE COURT:* YES.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, IN THE PRESENCE OF
THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* EXCUSE ME, MR. COCHRAN, MR. DOUGLAS, WHY DON'T YOU BE
SEATED UNTIL I FINISH INSTRUCTING THE JURY.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, BE SEATED, PLEASE. THANK YOU. ALL
RIGHT. GOOD MORNING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

*THE JURY:* GOOD MORNING.

*THE COURT:* EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE SMILING TODAY. GOOD. ALL RIGHT.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, I NEED TO ADVISE YOU OF CERTAIN
THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS HAS FALLEN ILL, MR. HODGMAN,
AND HE IS NOT WITH US TODAY; HOWEVER, THE PARTIES HAVE ELECTED TO
PROCEED IN HIS ABSENCE. ALSO, I NEED TO INSTRUCT YOU AND TO EXPLAIN TO
YOU SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THE DELAY THAT WE HAVE HAD FOR OVER THE PAST
TWO DAYS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, THE LAWS GOVERNING CRIMINAL
PROCEDURE IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRE THAT EACH SIDE DISCLOSE AND GIVE TO THE
OTHER SIDE THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS THEY INTEND TO PRESENT AS WITNESSES
AND ANY WRITTEN RECORD OR RECORDING OF THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THESE
WITNESSES. THE LAW ALSO REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF ANY REAL OR TANGIBLE
EVIDENCE. THESE DISCLOSURES MUST BE MADE BEFORE TRIAL IF THE WITNESSES
OR EVIDENCE ARE THEN KNOWN. THESE LAWS EXIST TO PROMOTE THE
ASCERTAINMENT OF TRUTH IN TRIALS, TO SAVE COURT TIME AND TO AVOID THE
NECESSITY FOR FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS AND POSTPONEMENTS. DURING THE
COURSE OF THE OPENING STATEMENTS DEFENSE COUNSEL MENTIONED WITNESSES WHO
HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN DISCLOSED TO THE PROSECUTION OR WHOSE WRITTEN
STATEMENTS WERE NOT GIVEN TO THE PROSECUTION BEFORE TRIAL, AS REQUIRED
BY LAW. THIS VIOLATION OF THE LAW -- THIS WAS A VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND
ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THE TWO-DAY DELAY, INCLUDING THE ABSENCE OF MR.
HODGMAN. KEEPING IN MIND THAT STATEMENTS BY THE LAWYERS ARE NOT
EVIDENCE, YOU ARE DIRECTED TO DISREGARD THE COMMENTS OF DEFENSE COUNSEL
DURING HIS OPENING STATEMENT AS THEY PERTAIN TO THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL
WITNESSES: MARY ANNE GERCHAS, MICHELLE ABUDRAHM, MARK PARTRIDGE, HOWARD
WEITZMAN, SKIP TAFT, CHRISTIAN RIECHARDT. IF AND WHEN THESE WITNESSES
ARE PRESENTED TO YOU DURING THIS TRIAL, YOU MAY CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF
THIS DELAY IN DISCLOSURE, IF ANY, UPON THE CREDIBILITY OF THE WITNESSES
INVOLVED AND GIVE TO IT THE WEIGHT TO WHICH YOU FEEL IT IS ENTITLED.
PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, AND THIS IS IMPORTANT, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE
FAILURE OF THE DEFENDANT'S ATTORNEYS TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW IS NOT
EVIDENCE OF THE DEFENDANT'S GUILT AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS SUCH
BY YOU. ALL RIGHT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE WILL NOW CONCLUDE THE
DEFENSE OPENING STATEMENT. MR. COCHRAN, DO YOU WISH TO CONCLUDE YOUR
REMARKS?

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES, I DO. THANK YOU VERY KINDLY, JUDGE ITO.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

OPENING STATEMENT (RESUMED)

BY MR. COCHRAN: JUDGE ITO, COLLEAGUES FOR THE DEFENSE, COLLEAGUES FOR
THE PROSECUTION, GOOD MORNING AGAIN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

*THE JURY:* GOOD MORNING.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THIS MORNING AGAIN I WILL BE ASSISTED BY MR. CARL DOUGLAS
WITH REGARD TO SOME GRAPHICS THAT WE HAVE, AND BY MR. HOWARD HARRIS HERE
ALSO WITH REGARD TO THE GRAPHICS. AS YOU WILL RECALL FROM OUR DISCUSSION
LAST WEEK, IN DISCUSSING THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE CORONER'S
OFFICE AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW REGARDING
THEIR SHORTFALLS. WE HAVE SOUGHT TO REPLY TO THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
BROUGHT UP BY THE TWO PROSECUTORS IN THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS. AND I
BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAD REACHED THE POINT WHERE I TOLD
YOU WE WERE ABOUT TO DISCUSS THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THEIR
HANDLING OF THIS MATTER. I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE LOS
ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS THE MAIN INVESTIGATING AGENCY IN THIS
PARTICULAR CASE. THE TWO MAIN DETECTIVES ARE DETECTIVE PHILIP VANNATTER
AND DETECTIVE TOM LANGE. THEY ARE FROM THE ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION AND
THEY WERE ASSIGNED THIS CASE IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 13,
1994. IN THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION TODAY WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE
EVIDENCE WHICH WAS SEIZED OR COLLECTED AT THE SCENE OF BUNDY AND ALSO AT
ROCKINGHAM. MAY WE HAVE THE FIRST GRAPHIC NOW. UNDER THIS SCENARIO, WE
EXPECT TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE EVIDENCE, THAT IS,
WHETHER OR NOT THIS EVIDENCE IS CAPABLE OF YOUR BELIEF, WHETHER OR NOT
IT IS EVIDENCE THAT IS CORRECT AND APPROPRIATE. HOW WAS IT COLLECTED?
AND SO FOR THE GRAPHIC THERE, ALL THE EVIDENCE PICKED UP AT THE NICOLE
BROWN SIMPSON CONDO AT THE TOP, THE EVIDENCE PICKED UP AT THE SIMPSON
HOME ON ROCKINGHAM, THE EVIDENCE FROM THE BRONCO, ANY BLOOD, ALL WENT
FIRST THROUGH THE LAPD THERE AND THEN ULTIMATELY FROM LAPD IT WAS SENT
OUT TO THE VARIOUS LABS, BE IT THE FBI, CELLMARK OR THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE. THIS GRAPHIC SEEKS TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE. YOU CAN SEE THE
LAPD THEN REMAINS A FOCAL POINT IN THEIR COLLECTION OF ALL THE EVIDENCE
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO LOOK AT. WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE
WILL SHOW THAT THIS EVIDENCE THAT WAS COLLECTED AT THESE VARIOUS
LOCATIONS THAT YOU HAVE JUST SEEN WAS CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED AND
ULTIMATELY CORRUPTED. IN THE COURSE OF THE EVIDENCE WE EXPECT TO SHOW
THAT. NEXT. NOW, BRIEFLY LAST WEEK I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT A DETECTIVE
NAMED MARK FUHRMAN. MR. FUHRMAN AND HIS PARTNER, MR. PHILLIPS, WORKED
WEST LOS ANGELES HOMICIDE, AND THEY ARE THE TWO DETECTIVES WHO FIRST
WERE ASSIGNED TO THIS CASE BEFORE ROBBERY/HOMICIDE GOT INVOLVED.
ROBBERY/HOMICIDE IS DOWNTOWN, I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW. THESE TWO
DETECTIVES WORKED IN WEST LOS ANGELES WHERE THESE CRIMES HAD OCCURRED
AND THEY WERE THE FIRST ONES TO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE. ALTHOUGH YOU DIDN'T
HEAR ABOUT MR. FUHRMAN IN THE COURSE OF THE OPENING STATEMENT OF THE
PROSECUTION, WE THINK HE WILL BE A KEY WITNESS IN THIS CASE. LET ME TELL
YOU WHY I THINK HE WILL BE A KEY WITNESS. I BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL
SHOW THAT HE AND HIS PARTNER, DETECTIVE PHILLIPS ARRIVED AT THAT SCENE
SOMETIME AFTER TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THESE
BODIES WERE FOUND SOMEWHERE AROUND 12:15 ON JUNE 13, 1994. AFTER
ARRIVING AT THE SCENE MR. FUHRMAN DID A NUMBER OF THINGS. YOU SAW HIM IN
ONE OF THE PICTURES LAST WEEK WHERE HE WAS POINTING DOWN AT ALLEGEDLY
THE GLOVE AND THE CAP THAT WAS UNDER SOME SHRUBBERY, IF YOU RECALL. THAT
WAS A PICTURE OF MR. FUHRMAN AT THAT POINT. YOU NOTICE THAT HE HAD --
HIS SHOES WERE NOT COVERED, THAT HE HAD WALKED IN THAT LOCATION AT THAT
POINT WITHOUT SHOES BEING COVERED, THAT HE MADE A NUMBER OF DISCOVERIES
AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT. THAT THERE WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER AT SOME TIME AT
THAT SCENE, AT THE BUNDY LOCATION, THAT THIS PHOTOGRAPHER WAS THEN
SUMMONED, ALONG WITH PHILLIPS, HIS PARTNER, AND VANNATTER AND LANGE, TO
GO OVER TO THE ROCKINGHAM ADDRESS. WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT
PRESUMABLY THEY WERE GOING OVER THERE TO GIVE NOTICE TO MR. SIMPSON
ABOUT THE DEATH OF HIS EX-WIFE AND PRESUMABLY THAT THE CHILDREN WERE IN
POLICE CUSTODY AT THAT POINT. APPARENTLY THE PARTIES WERE NOT NOTIFIED
OF EITHER MR. -- MRS. NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON OR THE GOLDMANS AT THIS
POINT, BUT THEY WENT OVER TO O.J. SIMPSON'S RESIDENCE. YOU RECALL ALSO I
TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD CONTACT
WITH THE SIMPSONS. HE HAD RESPONDED TO THE SO-CALLED 1985 INCIDENT. HE
DIDN'T WRITE A REPORT AT THAT TIME, BUT IN 1989 HE WROTE A WRITTEN
REPORT AND IN THAT REPORT HE TALKS ABOUT THE INCIDENTS OF -- THE '85
INCIDENT BEING INDELIBLY IMPRESSED UPON HIS MIND, SO HE DID HAVE
CONTACT, HAD BEEN TO THE ROCKINGHAM LOCATION. NOW, THE EVIDENCE I THINK
WILL SHOW THAT HE WILL ALLEGE THAT THE REASON WHY HE WAS STILL LEADING
DETECTIVE VANNATTER AND LANGE OVER TO THE ROCKINGHAM ADDRESS IS BECAUSE
HE KNEW WHERE IT WAS, BUT I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL ALSO SHOW FROM
DETECTIVE VANNATTER THAT HE, TOO, HAD ALSO WORKED IN WEST LOS ANGELES
AND HE KNEW THE WAY OVER THERE. BUT AT ANY RATE I THINK YOU WILL FIND
THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT ALL FOUR OF THESE DETECTIVES, THIS IS
PRIOR OF COURSE TO THE CORONER EVER BEING NOTIFIED, LEAVE THE BUNDY
CRIME SCENE AND THEY GO OVER TO ROCKINGHAM. ONCE AT ROCKINGHAM DETECTIVE
FUHRMAN OF COURSE -- NOW BY THIS TIME THE CASE IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF
THE CAPABLE INDIVIDUALS FROM DOWNTOWN ROBBERY/HOMICIDE. HE CONTINUES TO
PLAY AN INTEGRAL PART IN THIS CASE. I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT
HE, IN LOOKING AT THE BRONCO -- NOW, IT IS STILL, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, I
THINK STILL DARK OUTSIDE -- BUT IN LOOKING AT THE BRONCO IT IS NOW MAYBE
GETTING CLOSE TO FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, MAYBE LIGHT IS ABOUT UP,
HE DISCOVERS WHAT HE BELIEVES IS A SPECK OF BLOOD ON THE DOOR. THIS IS
DETECTIVE FUHRMAN. HE DISCOVERS SOME MORE BLOOD ALLEGEDLY DOWN TOWARD
THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR, THAT AT SOME POINT WHEN THESE OFFICERS CAN'T
ROUSE ANYBODY AT THE LOCATION, DETECTIVE FUHRMAN IS THE ONE WHO CLIMBS
OVER THE WALL TO GO INTO THE PREMISES. ONCE IN THE PREMISES, HE IS THE
ONE WHO INTERROGATES MR. KATO KAELIN, THAT HE IS THE ONE WHO ALSO, AFTER
TALKING TO MR. KAELIN, GOES BACK AND FINDS THIS GLOVE, THE ALLEGED RIGHT
GLOVE, AT ROCKINGHAM. WE HAVE NOW FOR YOU SOME VIDEO RELATING TO
DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN, AND I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE
HAS TO SAY WITH REGARD TO THE GLOVE. NOW, IN FAIRNESS TO DETECTIVE
FUHRMAN, THE QUESTION HE IS GOING TO ASK IS ABOUT THE GLOVE AND THEY
TALK ABOUT THE GLOVE, BUT IN HIS RESPONSE, YOU WILL SEE HE AT SOME POINT
TALKS ABOUT SEEING THEM AT THE FOOT OF MR. GOLDMAN. MR. HARRIS, SIR.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOU RECALL AND HEARD THE TESTIMONY THAT "I COULD SEE THEM
DOWN AT HIS FEET," AND THE QUESTION WILL BE SEEKING TO ESTABLISH IN THIS
TRIAL IS WHEN HE SAID HE SAW THEM DOWN AT THE FEET, WAS HE TALKING ABOUT
TWO GLOVES AT THAT POINT? NOW, THIS DETECTIVE PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE AS
HE REMAINS AT THE ROCKINGHAM LOCATION. YOU RECALL LAST WEEK I MENTIONED
THAT WE EXPECT TO CALL A WITNESS BY THE NAME OF ROSA LOPEZ AT SOMEPLACE
-- AT SOMEPLACE IN THE CASE. ROSA LOPEZ GIVES NEXT DOOR TO MR. SIMPSON.
SHE IS A LADY WHO WAS EMPLOYED BY THE FAMILY THERE. SHE IS THEIR
HOUSEKEEPER. AND THERE WILL, WE BELIEVE, BE TESTIMONY THAT DETECTIVE
FUHRMAN HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ROSA LOPEZ ON THE EARLY MORNING HOURS,
AFTER ABOUT 7:30, EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, ON JUNE 13, 1994, AND AT
THAT TIME ROSA LOPEZ SHARED WITH HIM HER OBSERVATIONS THAT SHE HAD BEEN
OUTSIDE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THAT THE BRONCO VEHICLE PARKED THERE AT THE
CURB AT ROCKINGHAM WAS PARKED THERE AT APPROXIMATELY 8:15, 8:30. IT WAS
PARKED AT KIND OF A UNIQUE ANGLE. SHE HAD REASON TO REMEMBER THAT AS SHE
WENT OUTSIDE TO WALK HER DOG. SHE WILL ALSO TESTIFY THAT SHE CAME BACK
OUTSIDE TO WALK THAT SAME DOG AT ABOUT 10:20 P.M. SHE SAW THE BRONCO
PARKED IN THAT SAME LOCATION AND IT HAD NOT BEEN MOVED, THAT THE NEXT
MORNING, WHEN DETECTIVE FUHRMAN HAD SPOKEN WITH HER, THE BRONCO WAS
STILL PARKED AT THAT SAME ANGLE, AS THOUGH IT HAD NOT BEEN MOVED ALL
NIGHT. SHE WILL SHARE WITH YOU WHAT, IF ANYTHING, SHE SAID TO THE
DETECTIVE THAT MORNING. YOU WILL FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT HE REDUCED ANY
OF THIS CONVERSATION TO A REPORT, WHETHER OR NOT THAT REPORT WAS EVER
FORWARDED TO ANYBODY, WHETHER HE TOLD ANY OF THE DETECTIVES ABOUT IT. WE
EXPECT THAT SHE ALSO INDICATED TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN THAT MR. SIMPSON
LEFT THE -- HIS RESIDENCE SOMEWHERE AROUND 9:00 -- NINE O'CLOCK, AND
THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT HE AND MR. KATO KAELIN WENT TO GET A MC
DONALD'S HAMBURGER, THAT SHE WAS AWARE AND HEARD HIS VOICE WHEN HE LEFT
AND SHE HEARD WHAT SHE BELIEVED TO BE PROWLERS DURING THIS PERIOD OF
TIME AND BECAME QUITE FRIGHTENED. I EXPECT THAT SHE WILL ALSO TESTIFY
THAT SHE HEARD MR. SIMPSON'S VOICE AT AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, OR A LITTLE
AFTER, AND WHEN SHE ALSO HEARD HIS VOICE HE APPEARED AS THOUGH HE WAS
LEAVING AND SHE DID NOT HEAR ANY VOICE ANY MORE THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT.
THAT AFTER MR. SIMPSON'S VOICE WAS NO LONGER HEARD, AFTER HE PRESUMABLY
HAD LEFT THE ROCKINGHAM RESIDENCE, THAT SHE HAD HEARD MEN'S VOICES
BEGINNING AT ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK, LASTING UNTIL ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN
THE MORNING. SHE WAS NOT ABLE REALLY TO FALL ASLEEP UNTIL PERHAPS FOUR
O'CLOCK THAT MORNING AND WAS AWAKENED BECAUSE I THINK THE GARDENER CAME
THAT MORNING. AND SHE ALSO HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE FUHRMAN
WHO CAME AND SHOWED HIS BADGE AND THEN CAME INSIDE OF HER HOUSE. SO WE
THINK THAT IN TRUTH AND IN FACT DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN WILL PLAY A VERY,
VERY CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS CASE REGARDING HIS TESTIMONY. NOW, LET'S GO
BACK, IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE LAPD, AND LET'S LOOK AT THE
STATEMENTS REGARDING THE CORONER. YOU WILL RECALL LAST WEEK I INDICATED
TO YOU THAT THE CORONER'S OFFICE FOR SOME REASON WASN'T CALLED
INITIALLY. THEY ARRIVED AT THE SCENE ALMOST TEN HOURS AFTER THESE BODIES
HAD BEEN DISCOVERED. LET'S LOOK FOR A MOMENT, USING THE ELMO WITH MR.
HARRIS, AT THE SEQUENCE OF WHAT TOOK PLACE, AND FOR THE RECORD, I WILL
READ CERTAIN THINGS INTO THE RECORD FROM THE TRANSCRIPT, YOUR HONOR. THE
UNDERLYING PORTIONS I WILL READ FOR THE RECORD. THIS PURPORTS TO BE, AND
WE WILL ESTABLISH THAT AT THE TIME OF TRIAL, THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT
TOOK PLACE ON JUNE 13, 1994, AT ABOUT 6:49 IN THE MORNING, JUST BEFORE
SEVEN O'CLOCK, AND IT IS A TELEPHONIC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DEPUTY
CORONER, PAUL WILLIS, AND DETECTIVE PHILLIPS OF THE LAPD, PHILLIPS BEING
FUHRMAN'S PARTNER.

"DETECTIVE PHILLIPS: I GOT A DOUBLE HOMICIDE THAT WE WANT TO LET YOU
KNOW ABOUT. IT IS GOING TO BE -- THE PRESS IS GOING TO BE CRAWLING ON US
LIKE ANTS WHEN THEY FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

"DETECTIVE PHILLIPS: THIS IS THE FIRST CALL AND WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO
DO YET, BUT WE NEED TO GET YOU GUYS ROLLING OUT HERE SO THAT WE CAN GET
THESE BODIES WHICH ARE VISIBLE FROM THE STREET OUT HERE AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE." IF I CAN DIGRESS FOR JUST A MOMENT. YOU WILL RECALL THAT HE
IS SAYING FROM PHILLIPS TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE AT 6:49 FOR BODIES THAT
WERE DISCOVERED BY THE POLICE AT 12:15 A.M. HE ALSO SAYS SOMETHING THAT
I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT IS VERY INTERESTING WHEN HE SAYS THAT:

"WE CAN -- GET YOU ROLLING OUT HERE FOR THESE BODIES WHICH ARE VISIBLE
FROM THE STREET." AND YOU WILL RECALL THAT WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU LAST WEEK
ABOUT ELLEN ARRONSON AND DAN MANDEL WALKING PAST THIS LOCATION AT 10:25,
NOT HEARING ANYTHING, NOT SEEING ANYTHING ON THE SIDEWALK DIRECTLY IN
FRONT OF 875, AND YOU HAVE SEEN THE OTHER PHOTOGRAPHS, WHAT YOU COULD
SEE FROM THAT SIDEWALK, AND IT IS CLEAR FROM HIS STATEMENT YOU COULD SEE
THESE BODIES, AND OF COURSE THERE WAS ALL THE BLOOD AT THE SCENE.
CONTINUING ON:

"WE'RE KIND -- WE KIND OF NOT FOLLOWING PROCEDURE, BUT WE ARE KIND OF
ASKING A FAVOR, AND YOU KNOW, KIND OF WORK A LITTLE BIT ON THIS ONE." SO
WE HAVE THE DETECTIVE AT THIS POINT, THEY ARE NOT FOLLOWING THEIR OWN
PROCEDURES AND THEY ARE ASKING THE CORONER'S OFFICE TO DO THEM A FAVOR
AND COOPERATE WITH THEM. THANK YOU. NEXT PAGE. PAGE 240, FOR THE RECORD,
DETECTIVE PHILLIPS AGAIN STILL TALKING TO THE DEPUTY CORONER, MR. WILLIS.

"DETECTIVE PHILLIPS: WELL, YOU CAN SEE THEM, YEAH, FROM THE STREET HERE.
THEY'RE -- THEY'RE A LITTLE OFF THE SIDEWALK HERE IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE,
BUT THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE GOING -- WHEN THIS THING BREAKS WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE NEWS FROM EVERYWHERE HERE. IT IS GOING TO BE A HIGH-PROFILE TYPE
DEAL. IT IS THE -- IT IS THE EX-WIFE OF A VERY PROMINENT SPORTSCASTER OR
SPORTS CELEBRITY." THEN HE IS ASKED A LITTLE BIT ABOVE, HE SAYS:

"OKAY. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST YOU ON THIS. IT IS O.J. SIMPSON'S
EX-WIFE." THAT IS PHILLIPS TELLING THE CORONER AGAIN AND HE GOES ON TO
SAY -- THE CORONER SAYS:

"OH, BOY. OKAY, UMM." AND PHILLIPS SAYS:

"AND HE IS IN CHICAGO." AND WILLIS SAYS:

"HE DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?" AND PHILLIPS SAYS:

"HE KNOWS NOW AND THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO BREAK THIS THING WIDE OPEN."
NEXT PAGE, PAGE 241, MR. HARRIS, SIR. NOW, MR. WILLIS HEARS THIS AND I
THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW HE IS THE CORONER, HE WANTS TO GET ROLLING,
AND ON THIS PAGE, OKAY, PAGE 241, HERE IS WHAT WILLIS SAYS:

"OKAY, UMM, YOU WANT US ROLL OUT NOW?"

AND THEN DETECTIVE PHILLIPS SAYS:

"HOLD ON A SECOND. TOM, TOM." AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW WHEN HE
SAYS, "TOM, TOM," I THINK IT IS DETECTIVE TOM LANGE. SO YOU ARE NOT
CONFUSED, THERE ARE TWO TOM LANGS IN THIS CASE AND THERE IS THE TOM LANG
ON THE SIDEWALK AND WHO SEES NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON ON THE SIDEWALK AND
THERE IS DETECTIVE TOM LANGE AND HE SAYS:

"HOLD ON A SECOND. TOM, TOM, DO YOU WANT THE CORONER NOW?

"NO. "HOLD ON A SECOND. HOW LONG?

"OKAY. YOU ARE JUST GETTING THE FIRST CALL." AND PHILLIPS GOES ON TO SAY:

"WE WILL GIVE YOU A CALL BACK WHEN WE WANT THEM MOVED," PRESUMABLY
MEANING THE BODIES, I SUPPOSE.

"DETECTIVE PHILLIPS: IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE ABOUT AN HOUR TO AN HOUR
AND A HALF." SO HERE WE HAVE THEM CALLING MORE THAN SIX HOURS, THE VERY
FIRST TIME, 6:49. THEN WHEN THE CORONER WANTS TO ROLL, SAYS, "DO YOU
WANT US TO ROLL NOW," THEY THEN SAY, "MAYBE AN HOUR TO AN HOUR AND A
HALF LATER."

MOVE TO THE NEXT PAGE PLEASE. ALL RIGHT. PHILLIPS SAYS:

"WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO GIVE THIS TO THE SUPERVISOR
BECAUSE I'M LEAVING NOW." PHILLIPS SAYS:

"ALL RIGHT." WILLIS SAYS:

"AND TELL THEM, UMM, THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE CALLING BACK ABOUT AN
HOUR, AN HOUR AND A HALF." PHILLIPS SAYS:

"OKAY. AND AGAIN WE DON'T WANT THAT OUT." THAT ESSENTIALLY ENDS THE
FIRST CONVERSATION. THEY PUT IT IN CONTEXT. LET'S SEE IF AND WHEN THEY
CALL BACK. AND WE WILL PRESENT EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT AT ABOUT 8:08 IN
THE MORNING ON JUNE 13, 1994, THERE WAS IN FACT A SECOND CONVERSATION
BETWEEN DETECTIVE PHILLIPS AND A MR. RICHARD HEATH THEN OF THE CORONER'S
OFFICE. DETECTIVE PHILLIPS SAYS:

"WE ALREADY GAVE YOU GUYS THE FIRST CALL SEVERAL HOURS AGO ON BUNDY.

"HEATH: YEAH.

"PHILLIPS: OKAY. CAN YOU GIVE ME AN ETA," AN ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL,
"IF YOU STARTED ROLLING NOW?" SOME CONVERSATION WITH PHILLIPS -- WITH
HEATH, RATHER, AND HEATH GOES ON TO SAY:

"YEAH, MY NAME IS HEATH, H-E-A-T-H, AND I COULD GIVE YOU APPROXIMATE
ARRIVAL TIME OF DRIVING TIME FROM THE MAIN OFFICE IN ABOUT MAYBE ANOTHER
FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES ADDED TO THAT." AND PHILLIPS SAYS:

"OKAY, SO YOU ARE TALKING -- TALKING A GOOD 45 MINUTES THEN?" DETECTIVE
PHILLIPS:

"TO AN HOUR." NEXT PAGE, SIR. DETECTIVE PHILLIPS SAYS:

"YOU ARE NOT GOING TO ROLL THEN FOR AN HOUR?" AND MR. HEATH RESPONDS:

"NO, WE WILL BE THERE WITHIN 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR." NOW, WE THINK THAT
THIS EVIDENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT EVIDENCE BECAUSE IT STARTS RIGHT AT THE
BEGINNING OF THIS INVESTIGATION BY THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT.
FIRST THEY HAVE ALREADY FAILED TO NOTIFY AND THEN WHEN THEY DO NOTIFY
THEY HAVE GOT SO MUCH WORK TO DO YET THAT WE KNOW THAT THE CORONER'S
OFFICE DOESN'T COME OUT THERE UNTIL -- THEY DON'T GET THE FINAL CALL
UNTIL 8:08, SO WE KNOW PERHAPS ACCORDING TO THIS MAN, MR. HEATH, IT IS
AT LEAST ONE HOUR OR SO AFTER THAT BEFORE THEY EVEN GET OUT TO THE
SCENE. YOU'VE HEARD ME MENTION DETECTIVE VANNATTER WHO IS THE DETECTIVE
IN CHARGE OF THIS SCENE, VERY EXPERIENCED DETECTIVE FROM
ROBBERY/HOMICIDE. AND AS WITH ALL OF THE WITNESSES IN THIS CASE, THEIR
CREDIBILITY WILL BE CHALLENGED AND WE WILL BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT
THEIR CREDIBILITY AND WHAT THEY DID THAT NIGHT AND HOW THEY CONDUCTED
THEMSELVES. YOU MUST DO THAT ALSO WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER. DETECTIVE
VANNATTER ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING, AT ABOUT 10:45, SOUGHT A SEARCH
WARRANT. THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW MR. SIMPSON WAS NOT IN LOS ANGELES; HE
WAS IN CHICAGO. THE DETECTIVE HAD GONE OVER THE WALL FIRST BUT AFTER
THEY SOUGHT A SEARCH WARRANT, THAT IS NOT RELEVANT, BUT WHAT IS RELEVANT
IS THE CREDIBILITY OF THE DETECTIVE AND WHAT HE SAID TO THE JUDGE IN
SEEKING TO GET THIS SEARCH WARRANT.

MR. HARRIS. AND WHAT IS THE NUMBER? WE SHOULD GIVE THE NUMBERS.

*MR. HARRIS:* THAT IS D-40.

*MR. COCHRAN:* ALL RIGHT. YOU WILL SEE IN THIS NUMBER --

*MR. HARRIS:* D-41.

*MR. COCHRAN:* -- D-41, A SEARCH WARRANT AND AFFIDAVIT AND YOU WILL SEE
IT IS SIGNED BY PHILIP L. VANNATTER ON JUNE 13, 1994, AT 10:45 IN THE
MORNING NOW, AND THIS IS AFTER THEY HAVE GONE OVER THE WALL, ET CETERA,
AND THIS IS AN APPLICATION TO A JUDGE TO TRY AND GO INTO THE HOUSE AND
SEARCH, A SWORN AFFIDAVIT.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-42.

*MR. COCHRAN:* ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THIS ONE --

*MR. HARRIS:* D-43A.

*MR. COCHRAN:* PULL THAT UP.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-43B.

*MR. COCHRAN:* NOW, HERE IS WHAT THE DETECTIVE IN A SWORN AFFIDAVIT SAYS
TO THE JUDGE TO GET THIS WARRANT.

"IT WAS DETERMINED SIMPSON HAD LEFT ON AN UNEXPECTED FLIGHT TO CHICAGO
DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 13, 1994." AND WE WILL INTRODUCE
EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THAT WAS A DIRECT MISREPRESENTATION AND UNTRUTH,
THAT THE POLICE KNEW FROM KATO KAELIN AND THE CONVERSATION WITH ARNELLE
SIMPSON THAT THEY HAD -- THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN ON A LONG-PLANNED
TRIP TO CHICAGO.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-44, D-45.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AND HE INDICATES THAT HIMSELF, THAT BY INTERVIEWS OF
SIMPSON'S DAUGHTER, THAT WOULD BE ARNELLE, AND A FRIEND, BRIAN KAELIN,
HE WRITES THAT IS IN -- THAT IS WHAT IS IN THE WRITING TO THE JUDGE TO
VERIFY THE FACT THAT O.J. SIMPSON HAS LIKE GONE ON THIS UNEXPECTED TRIP,
LIKE RUN AWAY TO CHICAGO, AND HE USES THAT AS A REASON IN TALKING TO THE
JUDGE.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-45A.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THE NEXT THING I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU IS THAT THAT IS
THE STATEMENT FROM BRIAN GERARD KATO KAELIN. WHAT IS THAT NUMBER, SIR?

*MR. HARRIS:* D-45B.

*MR. COCHRAN:* NOW, THIS --

*MR. HARRIS:* AND C.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU. THIS STATEMENT FROM BRIAN GERARD KAELIN, YOU
WILL NOTICE THIS STATEMENT WAS TAKEN BY THE POLICE JUNE 13, 1994, AT SIX
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WENT INTO
HIS ROOM AND TALKED TO THIS MAN IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS AND SIMPSON
-- THE STATEMENT IS SIMPSON TOLD HIM HE WAS GOING TO CHICAGO FOR HERTZ
CORPORATION, SO THEY KNEW WHY HE WAS GOING TO CHICAGO, THEY KNEW IT WAS
NOT AN UNEXPECTED TRIP, SO THIS WAS A LIE WHEN THEY WERE TALKING TO THE
JUDGE AT THAT POINT.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-49, D-50.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THE NEXT ISSUE OF CREDIBILITY DEALS WITH THE DETECTIVES
INDICATED TO THE JUDGE WHEN THEY WERE SEEKING THE SEARCH WARRANT THAT
THEY OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE HUMAN BLOOD LATER CONFIRMED BY
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION PERSONNEL, BEING HUMAN BLOOD ON THE DRIVER'S
HANDLE OF THE VEHICLE. WELL, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THEY MAY HAVE
CONFIRMED THAT AT SOME POINT MUCH, MUCH LATER, IF EVER, BUT THEY HAD NOT
CONFIRMED IT AT 10:45. IT WAS NOT HUMAN BLOOD. THEY COULD NOT CONFIRM
HUMAN BLOOD, SO THERE WAS ANOTHER MISSTATEMENT TO THE JUDGE AT THAT
PARTICULAR POINT. NOW, IN ADDITION TO THAT, AND I WILL READ THESE FOR
YOU, THE OTHER INACCURACIES OF SOME IMPORTANCE THAT WE THINK THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW ARE AS FOLLOWS: THE DETECTIVES, IN SEEKING THIS
PARTICULAR WARRANT, NEVER DISCLOSED TO THE JUDGE THE MANNER IN WHICH
ENTRY WAS MADE. THAT IS, THEY HAD ALREADY CLIMBED OVER THE WALL. THEY
NEVER BOTHERED TELLING THE JUDGE THAT.

AND FINALLY, THE FINAL INACCURACY THAT I THINK YOU WILL FIND OF SOME
GREAT RELEVANCE, THE FACT THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD IN FACT BEEN CONTACTED BY
DETECTIVE PHILLIPS AND HAD VOLUNTEERED TO COME HOME, TAKING AWAY FROM
THE WARRANT ANY IMPLICATION THAT HE HAD SOMEHOW FLED THE SCENE. THAT WAS
NEVER DONE. NOW, AGAIN, THIS IS THE EVIDENCE FROM THEIR FILES, AND BASED
UPON WHAT THEIR LEAD INVESTIGATOR SAID TO A JUDGE. AND AT SOME POINT IN
MY OPENING STATEMENT TODAY I WANT TO CHARACTERIZE FOR YOU HOW MR.
SIMPSON CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 13 WITH THE
WAY THAT THE DETECTIVES CONDUCTED THEMSELVES. THIS BRINGS US THEN TO A
DISCUSSION OF THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE, AND YOU RECALL BRIEFLY THE OTHER
DAY I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW ULTIMATELY
THIS WAS A PLACE OF THE GATHERING OF THE EVIDENCE AND WE THINK THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE CRIME SCENE TO
SECURE THIS AREA, THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE WALKING THROUGH THE
EVIDENCE, SHOULD NOT BE TRACKING UP THE EVIDENCE, SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHING
THINGS WITHOUT GLOVES, SHOULD BE IN SOME WAY PROTECTED BECAUSE THIS
EVIDENCE IS ALL VERY, VERY SENSITIVE. WE WOULD EXPECT THAT HOPEFULLY BY
THE TIME OF TRIAL YOU WILL ACTUALLY HAVE SOME FOOTAGE FROM LOCAL
TELEVISIONS OF HOW THE DETECTIVE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE OUT THERE AND
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE IN FACT WEARING ANYTHING OVER THEIR SHOES. YOU
HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN THE PROSECUTION'S OPENING STATEMENT DETECTIVE
FUHRMAN'S SHOES AND HOW THEY EXISTED AT THE TIME. WE THINK THE EVIDENCE
WILL SHOW THAT THIS SCENE WAS TRACKED AND TRAIPSED UP AND THE GATHERING
OF EVIDENCE WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER, AND WE FEEL THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL
BE SHOWN TO BE CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED AND CORRUPTED, AS WE HAVE
INDICATED TO YOU EARLIER. NOW, YOUR HONOR, BEFORE WE SHOW THIS NEXT
GRAPHIC, I WANT TO SAY A WORD TO COUNSEL AND YOU MAY WANT TO USE YOUR
SWITCH.

*THE COURT:* I HAVE ALREADY --

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND
DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO DIRECT THE PHOTOGRAPHERS NOT TO
ATTEMPT TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE SCREEN IN THE COURTROOM.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE FAMILY OF MR. GOLDMAN BE AWARE WITH
REGARD TO THIS PICTURE. THIS IS THE ONLY PICTURE THAT COULD IN ANY WAY
CAUSE ANY CONCERN, BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON AT THIS POINT.

*THE COURT:* PLEASE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THIS PURPORTS TO BE A PHOTOGRAPH OF MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY
WHILE STILL AT THE SCENE OF THE BUNDY LOCATION AND YOU WILL NOTICE
SEVERAL THINGS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PHOTOGRAPH. I BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE
WILL SHOW, FIRST OF ALL, THAT THE LADY WHOSE SHOES ARE THERE, THESE
SHOES ARE UNCOVERED, SHE IS STANDING ON SOME KIND OF A WHITE SHEET OR
SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE. YOU CAN SEE BLOOD ON THIS PHOTOGRAPH. SHE HAS
NOTHING OVER HER SHOES AND SHE IS STANDING THERE. YOU SEE THE BODY AND
YOU WILL SEE SOMETHING ELSE INTERESTING. YOU WILL SEE SOME GLOVES. THESE
GLOVES WERE APPARENTLY -- THESE GLOVES HAVE BLOOD ON THEM AND THESE
GLOVES HAVE NOW BEEN DROPPED ON MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY. THESE GLOVES, THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, ARE TYPICAL OF THE KIND OF GLOVES THAT ARE USED AT
THE SCENE TO PICK UP EVIDENCE OR TO COLLECT VARIOUS AND SUNDRY THINGS,
AND YET YOU SEE THESE GLOVES NOW FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY IN THIS
FASHION AND WE THINK THIS IS TYPICAL OF THE WAY THINGS WERE CONDUCTED AT
THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION AT THAT TIME.

*THE COURT:* MR. HARRIS, WHAT WAS THAT?

*MR. HARRIS:* THAT WAS D-69.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU. WE EXPECT, AS WE INDICATED LAST WEEK, TO SHOW
THAT BASED AT THIS PARTICULAR CRIME SCENE AT BUNDY, THERE WILL BE A
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW, THAT ONE OF WHICH
IS THIS CRIME SCENE AND THE PATTERNS AT THE CRIME SCENE ARE CONSISTENT
WITH A MAJOR STRUGGLE. MR. RON GOLDMAN'S BLOOD, AS I TOLD YOU, SHOULD BE
ALL OVER THE PERPETRATOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE UPPER AND MIDDLE PARTS OF
THE PERPETRATOR'S BODY. YOU WILL RECALL THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN'S
DESCRIPTION THIS MORNING WHERE HE DESCRIBED THIS RATHER SMALL AREA WHERE
MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS FOUND, AND HE TALKED ABOUT A FENCE AND YOU HAVE
SOME PICTURES WITH A TREE IN THE AREA. IT IS A VERY SMALL AREA. HE HAD
TO GO OUTSIDE TO LOOK OUTSIDE THE FENCE TO SEE WHERE THE BODY WAS. IT IS
A VERY SMALL AREA. I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT IF THERE WAS THIS MAJOR
CONFRONTATION, AND YOU RECALL LAST WEEK MR. GOLDMAN'S HAND, BUT I EXPECT
THERE TO BE TESTIMONY THAT HIS HAND CAME IN BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA WITH ONE
OF THE PERPETRATORS THERE AND THERE WOULD BE SOME MARK OR SOME INJURIES,
IT WOULD SEEM, PLUS THERE ARE TREES, THIS FENCE AND THERE WAS A VIOLENT
STRUGGLE. SO IF YOU RECALL THE PICTURES OF

MR. O.J. SIMPSON LAST WEEK, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT
EVIDENCE AS TO THE LACK OF ANY MARKS, BRUISES OR ANYTHING OF THAT
NATURE. IN THE AREA -- WE EXPECT THE SCENE TO ALSO SHOW THAT IN THE AREA
WHERE THESE MURDERS TOOK PLACE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FOOTPRINTS IN A
VERY SMALL AREA, WHICH MEANS THAT MOST LIKELY THE PERPETRATOR HAD TO BE
THERE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, THAT THERE WAS THIS PATTERN OF FIGHTING. I
THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE IN THIS CASE THAT MR. GOLDMAN'S BLOOD IS ON
DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE LOCATION, WHICH MEANS THAT HE, TOO, WAS MOVING
AROUND, SO THERE WAS THIS KIND OF A CONFRONTATION OR THIS FIGHT THAT
WENT ON OVER A PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE ONE IS FIGHTING FOR ONE'S LIFE,
AND AS YOU KNOW, IT WAS A VIOLENT STRUGGLE IN WHICH HE ULTIMATELY WAS
STABBED SOME 31 TIMES -- 30 TIMES. THE PROSECUTOR INDICATED TO YOU ALL
THIS HAPPENED VERY FAST AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL SEE FROM THE EVIDENCE
THAT THAT IS NOT EXACTLY CORRECT, GIVEN THE SITUATION WHEN ONE IS
FIGHTING VALIANTLY FOR THEIR LIFE. THERE WAS SOME TESTIMONY LAST WEEK
ABOUT CERTAIN BLOOD DROPS I THINK BY THE PROSECUTORS THAT WERE AT OR
NEAR THE MANY FOOTPRINTS AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL FIND THAT IT WILL BE
VERY UNUSUAL AND THAT IT WILL BE A REMARKABLE OCCURRENCE THAT THERE ARE
ONLY FOUR DROPS OF BLOOD THAT THEY TALK ABOUT AND SO MANY, MANY
FOOTPRINTS. FURTHER, WE WILL LOOK VERY CLOSELY DURING THE COURSE OF THIS
TRIAL AT THE GLOVE, AT BOTH GLOVES. WE WILL LOOK AT THE GLOVE FOUND AT
ROCKINGHAM, THE RIGHT GLOVE. WE WILL LOOK AT THE GLOVE FOUND AT BUNDY.
AND WE WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE ANY CUTS ON THOSE
GLOVES CONSISTENT WITH ANY CUTS OR ANYTHING ON MR. O.J. SIMPSON'S HANDS.
WE EXPECT, AS I MENTIONED TO YOU LAST WEEK, THERE WILL BE FINGERPRINTS
ON THE RAILINGS THAT ARE FRESH AT BUNDY AND WE THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE
WILL SHOW THOSE FINGERPRINTS ARE NOT O.J. SIMPSON'S FINGERPRINTS. THAT
THERE ARE HAIRS ON THE CAP, THE GLOVE AT BUNDY THAT ARE NOT O.J.
SIMPSON'S. THAT THERE IS AT THE CRIME SCENE, I BELIEVE YOU RECALL WHEN
THE PROSECUTORS WERE MAKING THEIR CASE LAST WEEK, THERE IS A TRIANGULAR
PIECE OF PAPER SHOWN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH NEAR NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S HEAD
THAT WAS NEVER SAVED, APPARENTLY, BY THE POLICE. WE DON'T HAVE THAT. OF
COURSE YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN AND THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF OTHER
PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE WITH UNPROTECTED SHOES STANDING IN AND ABOUT THE
CRIME SCENE. THERE WILL OF COURSE BE ALSO PHOTOGRAPHS OF CRIMINALISTS
WITHOUT PROPER HEAD COVERING AND GLOVES ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN COLLECTING
AND SO I HOPE THIS GIVES YOU KIND OF A PREVIEW OF HOW THESE DETECTIVES
COLLECTED EVIDENCE AND HOW THEY DEALT WITH THIS PARTICULAR SCENE, A
SCENE THAT WOULD BE BEST VIDEOTAPED SO COULD YOU SEE EVERYTHING THAT
TOOK PLACE, OTHER THAN JUST STILL PHOTOGRAPHS, A SCENE THAT WOULD BE
BEST PRESERVED WHERE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR REAL BUSINESS ARE THERE,
NOT PEOPLE JUST WALKING AROUND AND TRAIPSING THROUGH THE EVIDENCE. YOU
WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL. NEXT WE WILL
COME TO THE BRONCO. REMEMBER ALL THESE PIECES OF EVIDENCE GO FROM THE
LOCATION, SUCH AS THE BUNDY, THROUGH LAPD, TO SOME OTHER PLACE, SO LET'S
NOW LOOK AT THE BRONCO, WHAT WE CALL THE BRONCO TIMELINE. MR. DOUGLAS,
WILL YOU PUT THE CHART UP, AND THEN MR. HARRIS. MR. HARRIS, THE NUMBER
ON THE --

*MR. HARRIS:* D-62 AND THE CHART HAS ANOTHER NUMBER.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* THE CHART IS 206, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, MR. HARRIS AND MR. DOUGLAS. NOW, YOU WILL SEE
IN THE EXHIBIT UP ON THE BOARD, THE LARGE BOARD, THE VIDEO EXHIBIT, YOU
WILL SEE A LADY AGAINST THE BRONCO. THAT IS THE BRONCO THAT WE HAVE --
WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT, AND THAT IS A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN ON JUNE 13, 1994,
AND YOU WILL SEE THE TOW TRUCK BEHIND THE BRONCO AND YOU WILL SEE THIS
LADY UP APPARENTLY PEERING IN THE WINDOW OF THE BRONCO.

AND WE EXPECT TO SHOW THAT THIS BRONCO, WHICH YOU HEARD THIS IMPORTANT
EVIDENCE, WAS NOT SECURE, THAT PEOPLE SUCH AS THIS LADY GRAPHICALLY ARE
ALLOWED TO WALK UP, TOUCH IT, AND WHEN THAT BRONCO LEFT THAT LOCATION
THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO COFFEE STAINS ON THE
HOOD OF THE PARTICULAR BRONCO THAT WASN'T SECURED, THAT WASN'T
PRESERVED, THAT IT WASN'T MADE SO THAT YOU COULD COUNT ON THAT EVIDENCE.

*MR. HARRIS:* THAT IS D-63.

*THE COURT:* DR. D, IS THAT YOU?

DR. DIMITRIUS: THAT IS MY COMPUTER, YOUR HONOR. I APOLOGIZE.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-64. D-65.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, MR. HARRIS. THE BRONCO WAS OF COURSE
IMPOUNDED, THE 1994 FORD BRONCO, AND THIS IS THE LICENSE OF THAT
PARTICULAR VEHICLE THAT YOU CAN SEE.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-66A AND D-66B.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WHEN THIS BRONCO WAS FIRST TAKEN AWAY IT WAS TAKEN TO A
PLACE CALLED THE PRINT SHED, TO CHECK FOR FINGERPRINTS. YOU WILL SEE IN
THIS FORM, THIS LARGE FORM, THIS IS A BLOW-UP OF THIS AREA. IN THE UPPER
LEFT-HAND CORNER THERE IS AN INDICATION OF "PRINTS, EVIDENCE, GIVE
SPECIAL CARE." THIS BOX IS APPARENTLY CHECKED AT THAT POINT AND YOU WILL
SEE "RHD" AND THIS STANDS FOR "ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION." THAT IS WHERE
THE DETECTIVES CAME FROM. SHE HAD CHECKED THIS SO THEY WILL BE GIVEN
SPECIAL CARE AT THIS POINT. MR. HARRIS.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-68A,-68B.

*MR. COCHRAN:* ALL RIGHT. THERE WERE SOME SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS TO "TAKE
THE BRONCO TO PRINT SHACK PAB ACROSS STREET OF PARKER CENTER AND THEY
NOTE FOR US THAT "THERE ARE TWO COFFEE STAINS" ON THE HOOD, DISREGARD,
NOT RELATED." YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THAT
SHOULD BE DISREGARDED; HOWEVER, BECAUSE IF THIS VEHICLE WAS PROPERLY
HANDLED, THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THOSE COFFEE STAINS WOULD
EVEN BE THERE. MR. HARRIS.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-69, D-70.

*MR. COCHRAN:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-71.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AFTER THE BRONCO HAD BEEN TO THE PRINT SHED, IT WAS THEN
REMOVED AND TAKEN TO THE IMPOUND AT A PLACE CALLED VIERTEL'S,
V-I-E-R-T-E-L-S, THE TOWING YARD HERE IN LOS ANGELES, AND YOU WILL SEE
ITS IMPOUND AND YOU WILL SEE THE 1994 FORD BRONCO AGAIN, AND AGAIN THE
LICENSE. MR. HARRIS.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-72 AND D-73.

*MR. COCHRAN:* LET'S SEE. WHEN THEY GOT THIS BRONCO AT VIERTEL'S, LET'S
SEE IF THEY USED THIS SAME FORM. ROBBERY/HOMICIDE, RHD, THIS YOU SEE,
AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THE CHECK WHERE THE PRINT OR EVIDENCE OR "GIVE
SPECIAL CARE" IS NO LONGER CHECKED. THERE IS NOTHING THERE, NOTHING IN
THAT LOCATION.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-74 AND D-75.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THIS WILL TELL YOU WHAT INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN REGARDING
THAT BRONCO AS EARLY AS JUNE 14, 1994, I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW.
THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE:

"HOLD UNTIL RELEASED TO REP FROM HERTZ CORPORATION." AND I THINK THERE
WILL BE EVIDENCE THAT THIS VEHICLE WAS ACTUALLY OWNED BY THE HERTZ
CORPORATION. YOU WILL NOTICE THAT NO SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS WERE TAKEN.
THIS VEHICLE WAS BEING HELD FOR RELEASE TO THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE
HERTZ CORPORATION AT THAT POINT. OF COURSE THEN NOW WE ARE BACK TO THIS
QUESTION THEN OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE EVIDENCE AND YOU HAVE THE BRONCO
THERE GOING THROUGH LAPD AND ANYTHING OUT OF THE BRONCO. NOW, I WOULD
LIKE TO WALK OVER, WITH THE COURT'S PERMISSION, TO MOVE A LITTLE CLOSER
WITHOUT BLOCKING ANYONE WITH THE SO-CALLED BRONCO TIMELINE.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND
DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I PROCEED, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* YOU MAY. THANK YOU.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU VERY KINDLY. THIS IS THE SO-CALLED BRONCO
TIMELINE AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU. THERE
WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT THE LAPD ANNOUNCES THAT THE ROCKINGHAM SITE WAS,
QUOTE-UNQUOTE, SECURED AND THERE WILL BE A MAJOR QUESTION REGARDING THAT
AND THAT IS IN JUNE. WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS THE SEARCH OF THE BRONCO FOR
BLOOD AND TRACE EVIDENCE ON JUNE 14TH. THEN WITHIN A DAY THEREAFTER, ON
JUNE 15, 1994, THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO VIERTEL'S AND THAT IS THE TOWING
YARD I JUST SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT AND THAT IS THE PLACE WHERE THERE WAS --
THE ONLY INDICATION WAS HOLD FOR RELEASE TO THE HERTZ CORPORATION. SO
YOU CAN SEE IN JUNE WHAT TOOK PLACE. NOW WE KNOW AND WE EXPECT THERE
WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT AS EARLY AS JUNE 15, THE DAY THAT VEHICLE, THE
BRONCO, WAS TOWED TO VIERTEL'S, THERE WERE DOCUMENTS TAKEN OUT OF THE
DRIVER'S SIDE POUCH. WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY FROM A MAN BY THE
NAME OF JOHN MERAZ, M-E-R-A-Z. MR. MERAZ WILL INDICATE THAT HE -- THEY
ALL KNEW DOWN THERE THIS IS O.J. SIMPSON'S VEHICLE. THAT HE GOT INSIDE
THAT VEHICLE AND GETTING INSIDE HE TOOK SOME RECEIPTS OR INVOICES, AND I
THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT SOME OF THOSE RECEIPTS OR INVOICES WERE
MADE OUT OR IN THE NAME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON. SO I THINK YOU WILL
FIND DURING THE COURSE OF THE EVIDENCE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON ALSO DROVE
THAT VEHICLE AND THIS WILL BE FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE
VEHICLE, PERHAPS HAD GONE TO THE CLEANERS OR SOMEPLACE TO PICK UP SOME
ITEM, BUT MR. MERAZ WILL TELL YOU THAT HE TOOK THESE ITEMS OUT OF THE
DRIVER'S SIDE POUCH ON OR ABOUT JUNE 15, 1994. HE WILL SAY THAT HE PUT
THOSE ITEMS BACK INTO THE BRONCO, BUT THE ITEMS WERE THEN SUBSEQUENTLY
STOLEN OR TAKEN IN ANOTHER BURGLARY OF THIS PARTICULAR CAR THAT
SUPPOSEDLY IS SECURE ON VIERTEL'S PROPERTY. THE UPSHOT OF IT IS THAT
TODAY, SEVEN MONTHS PLUS LATER, WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE RECEIPTS.
THEY HAVE BEEN STOLEN, THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN, THEY ARE GONE FROM THIS
SUPPOSED SECURE VEHICLE IN THE CUSTODY OF THE POLICE OR IN VIERTEL'S.
AND SO THIS BRONCO TIMELINE SEEKS TO SPELL THAT OUT FOR YOU. YOU WILL
NOTE IN GOING BACK THERE WE HAVE A SMALLER PICTURE OF THE WOMAN TOUCHING
THE BRONCO. THAT IS STILL WHILE IT IS AT THE SCENE.

YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED ON THE 14TH AND THEN THE 15TH AND THEN WE KNOW
MR. MERAZ TAKES THE DOCUMENTS INITIALLY ON THE 15TH AND I THINK HE SAYS
HE PUTS THEM BACK ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
THEY ARE KIND OF LIKE SOUVENIRS, I SUPPOSE, IF YOU BELIEVE WHAT HE TELLS
YOU, BUT VIERTEL'S DOES NOT REPORT THE REMOVAL OF THE DOCUMENT TO THE
POLICE AND POLICE THE COMMISSION UNTIL JUNE 11, 1994, UNTIL ALMOST A
MONTH LATER. THE OFFICIAL WORD COMES OUT THAT THESE DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN
TAKEN AND THEY ARE MISSING AND OF COURSE THEY THEN START AN
INVESTIGATION TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHERE THESE DOCUMENTS ARE. THIS BRONCO
TIMELINE TALKS ABOUT THIS WHOLE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE THINK THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THE BRONCO WAS IMPROPERLY STORED WITHOUT THE
APPROPRIATE HOLD AND THEN WHEN IT WAS IMPROPERLY STORED THAT SOME BAD
AND UNFORTUNATE THINGS HAPPENED WITH THE EVIDENCE HAVING BEEN LOST. NOW,
YOU WILL SEE BETWEEN THIS PERIOD OF JUNE 15, THAT IS THE DATE THAT MERAZ
GOT INSIDE WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO VIERTEL'S, AND AUGUST 26TH, DID NOT
OBSERVE THE SPECIAL CARE RULE TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF BIOLOGICAL
AND TRACE EVIDENCE. WE THINK THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT THIS VEHICLE
-- POSSIBLE FOR THIS VEHICLE, FOR ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO GET IN AND OUT
OF THAT VEHICLE AND THERE WAS NOT THE HOLD ON IT THAT IT HAD IN THE
PRINT SHED, THEN LO AND BEHOLD ON AUGUST 26TH, DURING THE PERIOD OF
AUGUST 26, 1994, AND SEPTEMBER 1ST, 1994, THERE WAS, DONE BY THE
PROSECUTION, AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH OF THE BRONCO FOR BIOLOGICAL AND TRACE
EVIDENCE AND THEY WENT BACK LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE TO USE DURING THIS
TRIAL. YOU CAN SEE THIS IS FOR A VEHICLE THAT HAD BEEN TOWED THERE ON
JUNE 15, SO WHAT IS THAT? TWO MONTHS PLUS? ALMOST TWO AND A HALF MONTHS.
GO BACK. NOW, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR EXTENSIVE SEARCH FOR BIOLOGICAL AND
TRACE EVIDENCE. THIS IS A VEHICLE THAT WE KNOW HAS BEEN BASICALLY
IMPROPERLY STORED, THERE HAS BEEN AT LEAST ONE BURGLARY OR TRESPASS, AND
MAYBE TWO, IF MR. MERAZ IS BELIEVED, YET THEY THEN GO BACK AND SEEK TO
GET OUT OF THERE, AND THIS GOES INTO WHAT I HAVE TRIED TO DESCRIBE FOR
YOU THERE, THE GRAPHIC OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE EVIDENCE, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT EVIDENCE, WHERE IT GOES BEFORE IT GETS TO YOU AND WHO HAS HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTAMINATE IT OR COMPROMISE IT OR IN ANY WAY CORRUPT IT.
THAT LEADS US TO THE POINT OF THIS INTEGRITY OF EVIDENCE BEING
CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED AND CORRUPTED, AND WE THINK THAT THE SAGA OF
THE BRONCO ILLUSTRATES THIS CONCEPT OF THE EVIDENCE BEING CONTAMINATED,
COMPROMISED AND CORRUPTED. THANK YOU.

NOW -- WE WILL NOW WITH YOUR PERMISSION TURN OUR ATTENTION NOW TO THIS
WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE DISCUSSION OF DNA EVIDENCE AND THE LOS ANGELES
POLICE DEPARTMENT. I SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS A SAYING THAT YOU HAVE
GARBAGE IN, YOU GET GARBAGE OUT, AND WE HAVE SEVERAL CHARTS THAT WE
THINK WILL BE ILLUSTRATIVE OF THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF DNA EVIDENCE AND
WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS. MR. DOUGLAS IS PLACING A CHART ON THE BOARD, AND
MR. HARRIS, DO YOU HAVE A LASER?

*MR. HARRIS:* NO, I DON'T.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AND WE PUT THE BLACK BOX UP BECAUSE AGAIN THIS DEALS ALSO
WITH THE INTEGRITY OF EVIDENCE. NOW, WITH REGARD TO THIS PARTICULAR
EXHIBIT, BEFORE I GET TO THAT, MISS CLARK, I WANT TO MAKE A FEW
STATEMENTS AND I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE GET TO THAT. ALL RIGHT.
NOWHERE I THINK WILL YOU FIND IN THIS CASE IS THE PROBLEM OF THE
EVIDENCE BEING CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED AND CORRUPTED, MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE AREA OF DNA TESTING. THIS IS, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, IS A VERY
NEW AND POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY. IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS POLICE DEPARTMENTS
AND CRIME LABS HAVE TRIED TO TRANSFER THIS DNA TEST THAT HAS BEEN USED
FOR RESEARCH AND MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND APPLY IT TO CRIME SCENE SAMPLES.
WE EXPECT ALL OF YOU WILL HEAR IN THE COURSE OF THIS, THE EVIDENCE, THIS
TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN SIMPLE OR EASY, AND SO I WANT TO
SHARE WITH YOU IN THE COURSE OF MY OPENING STATEMENT NOW SOME
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DNA TESTING FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES AND FORENSIC DNA
TESTING ON CRIME SCENE SAMPLES. REMEMBERING AS WE -- IN THE GRAPHIC,
THAT ALL EVIDENCE PASSES THROUGH FIRST THE LAPD'S HANDS. IF IT IS
COMPROMISED WHEN IT STARTS, IT IS COMPROMISED WHEN IT COMES OUT. IF THE
EVIDENCE WAS CONTAMINATED AT THE SCENE OR MISHANDLED BY THE LOS ANGELES
POLICE DEPARTMENT, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DNA TESTS ARE DONE AFTERWARDS,
HOW MANY TIMES THEY ARE DONE OR WHICH LABORATORIES DID THEM, THE RESULTS
WILL NOT BE RELIABLE WE CAN EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW. NOW, TO
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM OF CONTAMINATION, ONE MUST UNDERSTAND, FIRST OF
ALL, HOW SMALL THESE SAMPLES ARE, AND MR. DOUGLAS HAS GOTTEN AHEAD OF ME
JUST A LITTLE BIT. LET'S GO BACK TO THE SMALL AMOUNTS OF DNA FOR
ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES TO ILLUSTRATE THIS FOR YOU. THIS IS A CHART THAT
IS ENTITLED "SMALL AMOUNTS OF DNA FROM SPECKS OF BLOOD," AND WHAT WE
HAVE IS A REGULAR SIZE PENNY HERE AT THE FAR LEFT, AND I WANT YOU TO BE
ABLE TO COMPROMISE -- STRIKE THAT. I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE A
REGULAR SIZE PENNY WITH 20 NANOGRAMS OF DNA AND THAT AMOUNTS TO -- THOSE
OF YOU WHO CAN SEE VERY WELL, I AM POINTING TO IT, ALMOST LIKE A PIN
PRICK, 20 NANOGRAMS. MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE YOU WILL BE ASKED
TO MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING IS ONE/TENTH OF THAT AMOUNT, ONE/TENTH OF
THE 20 NANOGRAMS OR TWO NANOGRAMS, AN AMOUNT SO SMALL THAT YOU CAN'T
EVEN SEE IT. THAT IS THE WHAT -- WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE WITH
THIS CHART. THE PENNY, 20 NANOGRAMS, THE TWO NANOGRAMS, AN AMOUNT THAT
YOU COULD NOT EVEN SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE. MR. DOUGLAS -- THAT EXHIBIT I
WAS JUST REFERRING TO, YOUR HONOR, WAS --

*MR. DOUGLAS:* 207, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. COCHRAN:* NOW, MR. DOUGLAS.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* THIS IS EXHIBIT 210, YOUR HONOR.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND
DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, AND INCLUDING THE LAST
CHART THAT WAS TAKEN DOWN, THAT THESE SMALL MINUSCULE AMOUNTS OF DNA ARE
VERY EASY TO SPREAD AROUND. THEY CAN GET ON YOUR CLOTHES, IN YOUR HAIR,
TWEEZERS, SCISSORS, OTHER TOOLS, BE MOVED FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER
WITHOUT ANYONE SEEING OR KNOWING WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE -- THIS OF
COURSE IS HOW YOU GET CONTAMINATION. NOW, DURING THE COURSE OF MY
REMARKS TODAY AND THEN LAST WEEK, AND BEFORE THAT THE REMARKS OF THE
PROSECUTORS, WE HAVE ALL STOOD AT THIS PARTICULAR PODIUM. IF I SNEEZED
OR IF ANY SALIVA CAME OUT OR IF I SCRATCH MY HAIR AND ANY DANDRUFF WAS
THERE OR IF I TOUCH THIS AND I HAD ANY BLOOD ON MY FINGER OR A SPLINTER
THERE, IF MISS CLARK DID LIKEWISE, IF MR. DARDEN DID LIKEWISE, THEN OUR
DNA WOULD BE ON THIS AREA. AND IF I TOOK A HANDKERCHIEF OUT AND WIPED
THIS, THIS IS WHAT THEY DO IN LABS, THAT WOULD PICK UP THE VARIOUS DNA
THAT IS HERE. YOU CAN'T SEE IT, THAT IS HOW SMALL IT IS UNDER THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES. SO THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA. IF WE WERE TO WIPE IT ACROSS
HERE, OUR HANDKERCHIEF COULD NOW BE TAKEN TO THE LAB AND ALLEGEDLY
TAKEN. IN FACT, SOME MEDICAL LABS DO IN FACT DO THIS AND IT IS DONE IN A
LAB TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY CONTAMINATION. THAT IS HOW
THEY TEST IT TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY CONTAMINATION. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO
SEE IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE COMPATIBLE FOR A PARTICULAR ORGAN
TRANSPLANT, THEY CHECK TO SEE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THIS. IF I HAD BEEN
THE ONLY ONE HERE, YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND ONLY MY DNA, BUT IF MR.
DARDEN AND MISS CLARK WERE HERE, YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND THEIR DNA. IF
MR. VANNATTER HERE SNEEZED, YOU MIGHT FIND HIS DNA, SO THERE IS ALL KIND
OF WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVE THIS POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION. AND ONE OF THE
PROBLEMS WITH THE TEST IS THAT IT CANNOT TELL ONE PERSON'S DNA FROM
ANOTHER. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL -- AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE A
MIXED SAMPLE. THERE IS QUITE A CONTROVERSY, WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL
SHOW, ABOUT WHETHER SMALL MIXED SAMPLES CAN BE TESTED RELIABLY EVEN IF
EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE PROPERLY AND THERE IS NO CONTAMINATION, SO IF
YOU ADD CONTAMINATION TO IT, THEN YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE.
NOW, TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE -- THIS BOARD THAT I'M NOW GOING TO REFER
TO IS THE SO-CALLED DNA TESTING TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER BOARD. WHAT WE WANT
TO DEMONSTRATE HERE IS YOU WILL RECALL I SAID THAT OVER THE COURSE OF
THE LAST FIVE YEARS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO TRANSFER FROM NO
MATTER WHAT WE USE IN MEDICAL RESEARCH AND TO EXCLUDE SUSPECTS PRIMARILY
TO THE FIELD TO FORENSICS, TO CRIME SCENES, TO TRY AND MAKE IT WORK IN
THAT SETTING.

THIS IS, AS I INDICATED TO YOU LAST WEEK, CYBERSPACE OR 21ST CENTURY
TECHNOLOGY, AND I THINK YOU WILL FIND THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT THE
COLLECTION PROCEDURES ARE 19TH CENTURY OR COVERED WAGON COLLECTION
PROCEDURES AND THAT IS WHY IT IS SUCH A PROBLEM. AND SO IF YOU LOOKED AT
THIS MEDICAL RESEARCH AREA, IN GENERAL YOU COULD EXPECT THAT IN THE
MEDICAL FIELD THAT THERE ARE CLEAN SAMPLES, MORE THAN LIKELY IN A CLEAN
MEDICAL LAB, THE BLOOD IS CAREFULLY TAKEN UNDER ANTISEPTIC CONDITIONS IN
HOSPITALS, AND IN A FORENSIC SETTING DNA TESTING IS DONE BY DEFINITION
GENERALLY AND DIRTY SAMPLES ARE TAKEN FROM CRIME SCENES, FROM SIDEWALKS,
FROM CARPETS AND THEY ARE EXPOSED TO ALL SORT OF CONTAMINATION, THAT
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES, THAT THESE -- AS YOU KNOW ALREADY,
THESE ARE MINUTE SPECKS OF BLOOD, THERE MAY BE SALIVA, THERE MAY BE
SKIN, CELLS, DANDRUFF, AS I INDICATED TO YOU, EVEN A SPRAY OF A SNEEZE
CAN CONTAMINATE THE FORENSIC SAMPLE. SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IN THIS
SAMPLE, WE HAVE THESE CHARTS HERE, IS THAT IN COMPARING THE MEDICAL
RESEARCH, COMPARE THE MEDICAL RESEARCH WITH THE FORENSIC AND SEE WHICH
ONE IS MORE LIKELY TO BE RELIABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WELL, I THINK
THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT AS OPPOSED TO THE CLEAN SAMPLE AND THE
DIRTY SAMPLES, IN THIS INSTANCE THE CLEAN SAMPLE IN THE MEDICAL LAB WILL
BE FAR MORE RELIABLE, SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN RELY UPON. THE NEXT AREA WE
WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IS GENERALLY IN A MEDICAL LAB YOU HAVE A GENEROUS
SAMPLE SIZE, THE DOCTOR CAN HAVE WHATEVER SAMPLE SIZE HE USUALLY WANTS
OR NEEDS. IN FORENSICS THE SAMPLE COMES GENERALLY IN VERY, VERY LIMITED
MINUTE AMOUNTS AND IN WORKING WITH SUCH SMALL AMOUNTS OFTEN THE TEST CAN
ONLY BE DONE ONCE. AND OF COURSE WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT IS
-- IT IS HARDER TO PRODUCE RELIABLE RESULTS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.
IN FACT, YOU WILL HEAR WE THINK IN THIS CASE, THAT MOST OF THE IMPORTANT
DNA TESTS PERFORMED BY THE PROSECUTION WERE DONE WITH AMOUNTS OF DNA
THAT WERE ACTUALLY BELOW THE PREFERRED AMOUNTS FOR RELIABLE TESTING. SO
IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE MEDICAL RESEARCH LABS HAVING A GENEROUS SAMPLE
SIZE AND THEN IN THE FORENSICS AREA HAVING MINUSCULE SAMPLE SIZE, AGAIN
YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION IN THE MINUSCULE
SAMPLE SIZE AND THAT BRINGS US DOWN TO THE UNMIXED SAMPLE FROM KNOWN
SOURCES. AS YOU KNOW, AND MISS CLARK ALLUDED TO THIS IN HER STATEMENT,
IN A MEDICAL SETTING YOU HAVE SAMPLES THAT YOU KNOW. IF YOU HAVE A LADY
WHO IS GOING TO HAVE AMNIOCENTESIS, YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS. IF YOU HAVE A
PERSON WHO IS GOING TO GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE A KIDNEY, YOU KNOW WHO THEY
ARE, SO YOU HAVE KNOWN SOURCES THAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH, AND I THINK
THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE, I THINK YOU WILL SEE, DURING THE COURSE OF
THE TESTIMONY. IN MEDICAL TESTING WE TAKE THESE UNMIXED SAMPLES FROM
KNOWN PERSONS AND IN FORENSICS WE TAKE THESE SAMPLES IN VARYING AMOUNTS
FROM UNKNOWN PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO HAS WALKED OUT THERE, WHO
HAS WALKED, WHO HAS SNEEZED, WHO HAS BLED, WHO HAS SCRATCHED THEIR HEAD.
YOU DON'T KNOW OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. WE EXPECT YOU WILL HEAR IN THIS
AREA THAT THE NEW FORMS OF DNA TESTING USED BY THE PROSECUTION IN THIS
CASE ARE JUST NOT RELIABLE ENOUGH WHEN USING AND ANALYZING MIXTURES FROM
UNKNOWN SOURCES AND THE KEY HERE BEING MIXED SAMPLES FROM UNKNOWN
SOURCES. SO AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN ON FORENSICS, IN THE HIGHER RISK OF
CONTAMINATION, THEN IN THE LAB, IN THE MEDICAL RESEARCH AREA, THERE IS
GENERALLY MINIMAL HANDLING. THIS IS FAIRLY CLEAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD.
LESS HANDLING THAN AT THE SCENE WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE GOING OUT TRYING
TO COLLECT SOMETHING. CONTRARY, AS I SAID, TO WHAT THE PROSECUTOR TOLD
YOU LAST WEEK, THE EVIDENCE WILL BE IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS WIPING UP A
SPILL IN YOUR KITCHEN. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS SO SENSITIVE, IT IS NOT THAT
SIMPLE AT ALL. YOU AND I JUST SHOULDN'T GO OUT AND DO THIS. WE CAN DO IT
IF WE WANTED TO USE THE SAME TECHNIQUE THEY USE WITH THE LAPD, BUT YOU
WILL GET RESULTS THAT ARE ALL UNRELIABLE, SO BETWEEN MINIMAL HANDLING
AND MULTIPLE HANDLING YOU CAN SEE AGAIN THAT THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF
CONTAMINATION WITH THE MULTIPLE HANDLING. ERROR RATES BETWEEN KNOWN --
AND THAT IS BECAUSE I THINK YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY THAT IN THE MEDICAL
LABS THEY SUBJECT THEIR RESULTS AND THINGS TO TESTS. I MENTIONED THE
WIPE TEST. IN LABS THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
CONTAMINATION IN THE LABS WHEN YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR. YOU WANT TO HAVE
THE DOCTOR MAKE SURE HIS LAB IS CONTAMINATION FREE AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE.
THAT BRINGS ABOUT CONFIDENCE AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE, A WHOLE
INDUSTRY BASED UPON. TRANSFERRING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE FORENSICS AREA,
THE ERROR RATES ARE NOT NEARLY AS WELL KNOWN, AS I THINK YOU CAN SEE, SO
AGAIN THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION AND ERROR IN THIS AREA
ALSO. I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE TESTIMONY THAT THE
LABS HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD FOR DOING DNA TESTING IN MEDICAL
LABORATORIES, THEY ARE MUCH STRICTER ON THEMSELVES THAN THE STANDARD
THAT FORENSICS AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND LABORATORIES ARE USING.
AND SO YOU CAN SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. IN ONE CASE, WHEN YOU ARE
TALKING ABOUT THESE HIGHER STANDARDS, YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR
NOT YOUR ORGANS WILL BE COMPATIBLE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN ORGAN TRANSFER
OR OTHER AND THE OTHER YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SOMEBODY'S FREEDOM, THEIR
VIRTUAL LIFE, SO WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT UNDER THIS SCENARIO
WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE NOT HIGHER CLINICAL LAB STANDARDS THAN YOU ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT SOMEBODY AT THE HOSPITAL THAN YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE
CONCERNED WITH SOMEBODY ON TRIAL FOR THEIR VERY LIFE. GIVEN THE LOWER
STANDARDS AND THE LACK OF TESTING AGAIN IN THIS AREA, AGAIN IN THIS
AREA, IN FORENSICS, THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION AND ERROR. I
MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, BUT IN THE LABS THERE IS THIS RIGOROUS
PROFICIENCY TESTING, AND OF COURSE I THINK YOU WILL FIND, AND THE
TESTIMONY WILL BE, THAT IN FORENSICS VERY RARELY DO THEY DO ANY BLIND
TESTING. NO OUTSIDE AGENCIES. THEY GIVE THEMSELVES EASY TESTS AND ALMOST
NEVER TAKE BLIND EXTERNAL PROFICIENCY TESTS, AND THAT HAS A REAL BEARING
ON THE OVERALL PROFICIENCY HERE. AND SO AGAIN, I THINK YOU WILL FIND
THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION AND ERROR IN THE FORENSICS AREA
AGAIN.

AND FINALLY, WITH REGARD TO STATISTICAL CONTROVERSY IN THIS AREA, IN
MEDICAL TESTING, USUALLY YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO SEE IF SOMEONE HAS
INHERITED A COPY OF THE DISEASED GENE FROM THEIR PARENT OR WHATEVER, HAS
THE CORRECT GENETIC TYPES FOR TRANSPLANTATION OF AN ORGAN, HAS BEEN
INFECTED WITH A HARMFUL BACTERIA OR VIRUS. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR, AND THERE IS NO ELABORATE STATISTICAL ESTIMATES ARE NEEDED TO GET
RELIABLE TEST RESULTS FOR THAT. IN FORENSICS WE THINK YOU WILL HEAR
TESTIMONY THAT THERE IS A BITTER AND COMPLICATED STATISTICAL CONTROVERSY
REGARDING THIS ENTIRE AREA, DNA, SPECIFICALLY PCR, ABOUT A DNA MATCH AND
WHAT A MATCH MEANS. AND WHILE WE ARE ABOUT IT, I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL
SHOW, WHEN YOU HEAR THE PROSECUTOR TALKING ABOUT IT IS A MATCH, IT IS A
MATCH, IT IS A MATCH, WHAT SHE REALLY MEANS TO SAY IS THAT IT IS
CONSISTENT WITH -- THESE ARE NOT FINGERPRINTS -- CONSISTENT WITH SOMEONE
ELSE'S GENOTYPE OR WITH THEIR BLOOD TYPE. SO WITH REGARD TO THIS WHOLE
AREA OF STATISTICAL CONTROVERSY, AGAIN THE FORENSICS AREA, THE HIGHER
RISK OF CONTAMINATION ERROR IN THIS AREA AGAIN. SO AS YOU LOOK AT THIS
-- THIS CHART, YOU LOOK AT BLOOD ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT, YOU CAN SEE
CLEARLY, AND I EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO BE THAT BECAUSE OF THE DIRTY
SAMPLES, THE MINUSCULE SAMPLE SIZE, THE MIXED SAMPLE FROM UNKNOWN
SOURCES, THE MULTIPLE HANDLING, THE ERROR RATES NOT WELL-KNOWN, THE LOW
LAB STANDARDS, THE EASY PROFICIENCY TESTING, AND THE MAJOR STATISTICAL
CONTROVERSY, THAT IN ALL THOSE AREAS IN SEEKING TO TRANSFER THIS
TECHNOLOGY TO FORENSICS IS FRAUGHT WITH ALL KIND OF PROBLEMS AND THIS IS
A MUCH HIGHER RISK OF CONTAMINATION AND ERROR. NOW, WE EXPECT THAT
DURING THIS HEARING YOU WILL HEAR SOME ASTRONOMICAL NUMBERS PRESENTED
REGARDING THE DNA TEST RESULTS, AND THESE NUMBERS ARE PART OF WHAT I WAS
TELLING YOU, THE STATISTICAL CONTROVERSY, WHETHER OR NOT THESE ARE
ACCEPTED IN THE SCIENCE AND THESE NUMBERS ALSO ONLY ADDRESS GENE
FREQUENCIES. THESE ARE NOT FINGERPRINTS. AND THE NUMBERS THAT YOU WILL
HEAR, IF YOU HEAR THEM IN THIS CASE, HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ISSUE
OF CONTAMINATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THEY DO NOT HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ISSUE OF LABORATORY ERRORS. THEY DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ISSUE OF TAMPERING, WHETHER THE SAMPLE WAS
TAMPERED WITH, AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OTHER IMPORTANT DNA
ISSUES WHICH YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT IN THE COURSE OF THIS CASE.

SPECIFICALLY UNDER THE DNA TESTING ASPECT, WE THINK THAT YOU WILL HEAR
TESTIMONY IN THIS CASE ABOUT POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION, SO-CALLED PCR
TESTING, AND I THINK YOU WILL FIND OUT IN HERE THAT THE VERY BEST
MEDICAL AND RESEARCH LABS THAT DO PCR HAVE CONTAMINATION PROBLEMS. AND
AS I MENTIONED TO YOU LAST WEEK, I THINK THAT YOU WILL HEAR, THAT THIS
IS AN AREA THAT PRESENTS A REAL PROBLEM. WE EXPECT DURING THE COURSE OF
OUR EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE TO SHOW THAT FROM THEIR OWN STUDIES THE LAPD'S
LABORATORY IS A CESSPOOL OF CONTAMINATION. LOOKING AT THEIR OWN RECORDS
AND THE TESTS THEY HAVE RUN WE WILL DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU WHAT THOSE
RECORDS SHOW. WE EXPECT THEN IN THIS ENTIRE AREA THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW
THAT THE CARELESS, SLIPSHOD NEGLIGENT COLLECTION, HANDLING AND
PROCESSING OF SAMPLES BY BASICALLY POORLY TRAINED PERSONNEL FROM LAPD
HAS CONTAMINATED, COMPROMISED AND CORRUPTED THE DNA EVIDENCE IN THIS
CASE. AND YOUR HONOR, THIS MAY BE A GOOD SPOT, UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO GO
FURTHER.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. ALL RIGHT. LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR RECESS FOR THE NOON HOUR. PLEASE
REMEMBER MY ADMONITION TO YOU. DO NOT DISCUSS THIS CASE AMONGST
YOURSELVES, FORM ANY OPINIONS ABOUT THE CASE. DON'T ALLOW ANYBODY TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE CASE. AND YOU ARE NOT TO PERFORM ANY DELIBERATIONS
ON THE CASE UNTIL THE MATTER HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO YOU AFTER THE
COMPLETION OF THE CASE. AND WE WILL RESUME AGAIN AT 1:30. ALL RIGHT. WE
WILL STAND IN RECESS. THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

(AT 11:55 A.M. THE NOON RECESS WAS TAKEN UNTIL 1:30 P.M. OF THE SAME DAY.)

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; MONDAY, JANUARY 30, 1995 1:35 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. 103 HON. LANCE A. ITO, JUDGE

APPEARANCES: (APPEARANCES AS HERETOFORE NOTED.)

(JANET M. MOXHAM, CSR NO. 4855, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(CHRISTINE M. OLSON, CSR NO. 2378, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, OUT OF THE PRESENCE
OF THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. ALL COUNSEL ARE
PRESENT EXCEPT FOR MISS CLARK. MR. DARDEN.

*MR. DARDEN:* SHE'S ON HER WAY DOWN, YOUR HONOR. IT'S HARD TO GET AN
ELEVATOR AT THIS TIME.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MS. CLARK:* I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK, I'M REMINDED OF AN EXPERIENCE I HAD AS A YOUNG
TRIAL LAWYER IN PASADENA. I RECALL TRYING A CASE IN JUDGE LADICK'S
COURTROOM, BEING LATE IN A JURY TRIAL, AND JUDGE LADICK HAD THE JURY OUT
SITTING IN THE BOX AS I WALKED IN LATE FROM LUNCH. AND HE NEVER SAID
ANYTHING TO ME, BUT I GOT THE MESSAGE.

*MS. CLARK:* IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME, YOUR HONOR. I APOLOGIZE. WE HAD A
LATE MEETING WHICH DELAYED LUNCH CONSIDERABLY, AND I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO
TAKE AS LONG AS IT DID.

*THE COURT:* WELL, KEEP THAT EXPERIENCE IN MIND. ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, LET
ME BRING UP ONE MATTER BEFORE WE INVITE THE JURORS TO REJOIN US FOR THE
CONTINUATION OF MR. COCHRAN'S OPENING STATEMENT. COUNSEL, WHEN YOU USE A
VIDEOTAPE OR AN AUDIOTAPE DURING THE COURSE OF THE OPENING STATEMENTS OR
ANYTIME DURING THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL AND THERE'S A TRANSCRIPT THAT'S
AVAILABLE, I FORGOT TO ASK YOU FOR THE NORMAL STIPULATION, THAT THE
COURT REPORTER NEED NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE DOWN WHAT IS ON THE VIDEO OR
AUDIOTAPE AT THAT TIME. AND, MR. COCHRAN, YOU DID USE THAT VIDEOTAPE
DURING THE COURSE OF YOUR OPENING STATEMENT. IS THAT STIPULATION
AGREEABLE TO YOU?

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES. I WOULD SO STIPULATE, THAT --

*MS. CLARK:* YES, SO STIPULATE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* -- SHE'S NOT TO TAKE THAT DOWN.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU, COUNSEL. DEPUTY MAGNERA, LET'S HAVE THE JURY,
PLEASE.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT, IN THE PRESENCE OF
THE JURY:)

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, PLEASE BE SEATED. ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

*THE JURY:* GOOD AFTERNOON.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. COCHRAN, DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE YOUR
OPENING REMARKS?

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES, I DO, YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU VERY KINDLY.

OPENING STATEMENT (RESUMED)

BY MR. COCHRAN: JUDGE ITO AND COUNSEL, GANG, GOOD AFTERNOON, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN. I CAN MAKE A PROMISE TO YOU AT THIS TIME THAT I WILL FINISH
THIS OPENING STATEMENT THIS AFTERNOON. BARRING ANY UNFORESEEN
CALAMITIES, WE'LL BE FINISHED THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE OPENING STATEMENT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE, AND I ASK YOU AGAIN TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND.
JUST BEFORE WE CONCLUDED LUNCH, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF
DNA. AND WE STILL HAVE SOME MORE DNA TO TALK ABOUT. I HAVE TWO CHARTS
NOW I WANT TO DISCUSS WITH YOU BRIEFLY. THEY'RE LABELED FOR THE RECORD,
"PCR AMPLIFICATION CHARTS." AND WE'RE SEEKING TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS
CONCEPT WORKS, THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION OR PCR. THIS TECHNOLOGY
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IS A FACET OF DNA TECHNOLOGY. PCR TESTS
TAKE THESE VERY, VERY SMALL SAMPLES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- AND
NOW YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF WHICH YOU CAN NOT EVEN SEE -- AND THEY ARE
AMPLIFIED UP, KIND OF A MOLECULAR XEROXING IF YOU WILL. AND THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE HERE. WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT
SCIENTISTS ARE NOT YET ABLE TO ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE SMALL AMOUNT OF DNA
CONTAINED IN MINUTE SPECKS OF BLOOD. THEY MUST FIRST AMPLIFY THE DNA SO
THERE'S ENOUGH OF IT TO EXAMINE. AMPLIFICATION OR AMPLIFYING DNA, AS I
SAID, IS LIKE MOLECULAR XEROXING. YOU START WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF DNA
AND THEY GO THROUGH THESE VARIOUS CYCLES. EACH CYCLE DOUBLES THE AMOUNT
OF DNA, AND THEY DO THIS 32 TIMES, THE EVIDENCE WILL BE, BEFORE THEY
HAVE ENOUGH DNA TO EXAMINE. NOW, THIS FIRST CHART SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU HAVE A SINGLE PIECE OF DNA THAT IS THEN AMPLIFIED OR DOUBLED 32
TIMES. AND THEN IT GOES FROM THIS ONE FRAGMENT THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO EVEN SEE TO OVER FOUR BILLION FRAGMENTS, AS IS INDICATED ON
THE PARTICULAR CHART. THAT IS THE MOLECULAR XEROXING MADE AS --
HOPEFULLY AS CLEAR AS WE CAN MAKE IT IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE EXPECT THE
TESTIMONY TO BE. MR. DOUGLAS, WILL YOU MOVE -- WHAT'S THE NUMBER OF THAT
CHART, MR. DOUGLAS?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* FOR THE RECORD, YOUR HONOR, THIS WAS NO. 208 AND THE NEXT
IS 209.

*MR. COCHRAN:* NOW, REFERRING AND DIRECTING YOUR ATTENTION TO NO. 209,
WHICH IS AN AMPLIFICATION OF FOUR FRAGMENTS, NOW, THIS CHART SEEKS TO
ILLUSTRATE FOR YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE MAY BE A MIXTURE OF DNA IN
THE SAMPLE, WHERE IT'S TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES -- AND YOU HEARD ME THIS
MORNING TALK ABOUT THE WIPE TEST WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF ON THIS
PARTICULAR PODIUM. THIS CHART SHOWS FOUR DIFFERENT FRAGMENTS OF DNA AT
THE START. AND AFTER THIS MIXTURE, LIKE WE DID IN THE PREVIOUS CHART, IS
AMPLIFIED UP, THERE WILL NOW BE OVER -- THE BOTTOM SHOULD BE 16 BILLION
OR 17 BILLION FRAGMENTS. EXTRA FRAGMENTS OF DNA, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW,
COULD GET INTO THE SAMPLE IN ANY NUMBER OF WAYS, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE
VICES OF THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM AND ITS RELIABILITY; FROM SOMEONE
COUGHING ON THE EVIDENCE, FROM FLECKS OF BLOOD WHICH MAY COME FROM ONE
SAMPLE BEING PASSED ON TO ANOTHER SAMPLE, FROM SPECKS OF BLOOD THAT
STICK TO A PAIR OF TWEEZERS IF THE TECHNICIAN IS USING THOSE OR
SCISSORS, FROM SOMEONE SHEDDING DEAD SKIN CELLS ON TO THE EVIDENCE, FROM
DANDRUFF, FROM ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. SO THE PROBLEM BECOMES, WHEN ONE
SEEKS TO -- WHEN ONE HAS MORE THAN ONE SAMPLE AND THE AMPLIFICATION GETS
INTO THE BILLIONS, WE STILL HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM AS YOU LOOK AT THAT.
THESE CHARTS -- WE EXPECT TO HAVE TESTIMONY FROM THE EXPERTS TO ADDRESS
THESE CHARTS. WE HOPEFULLY USED THESE TODAY TO MAKE THIS PROCESS A
LITTLE CLEARER TO YOU OF HOW THE PCR IS AMPLIFIED UP TRYING TO GET SOME
RESULTS. AND EVEN WHEN YOU GET THE RESULTS, AS I INDICATED THIS MORNING,
A MATCH DOESN'T MEAN LIKE A FINGERPRINT. IT MEANS CONSISTENT WITH
GENERALLY, AND THERE CAN BE -- IF THE CONTAMINATION GETS IN THERE, THEN
YOU CAN'T TELL ONE PERSON'S DNA FROM THE OTHER. AND WE CAN MOVE ON TO
THE NEXT CHART. NOW, IN THIS CASE, TRYING TO CONCLUDE OUR DISCUSSION OF
DNA SO EVERYBODY CAN WAKE UP AGAIN AND BE ALIVE AGAIN, THIS -- YOU HEARD
A LOT ABOUT DNA AND YOU WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT DNA EVIDENCE. THE
PROSECUTION WILL UNDOUBTEDLY PRODUCE SOME OF THESE TECHNICIANS WHO COME
IN FROM THE CRIME LAB WHO PERFORMED THE VARIOUS TESTS. AND YOU WILL
RECALL THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR HIGH-PROFILE CASE, THEY DESIGNATED AS THE
OFFICER IN CHARGE A MISS MAZZOLA, WHO IS A TRAINEE, WHICH THIS WAS ONLY
HER THIRD CRIME SCENE. SHE WAS SUPERVISED BY A MR. FONG, WHO WAS HER
SUPERVISOR THAT DAY. AND WE EXPECT THEIR TECHNICIANS WILL COME IN, TELL
YOU WHAT THEY DID, THE VARIOUS TESTS THEY CONDUCTED AND CONCLUSIONS
WHICH THEY HAVE DRAWN FROM THE TESTS. WE EXPECT TO PRESENT TESTIMONY
HOWEVER SOMEWHAT CONTRARY, INCLUDING SOME OF THE PEOPLE I TOLD YOU ABOUT
EARLIER, AND WE EXPECT THAT THE PEOPLE WE CALL WILL TELL YOU BASED UPON
THEIR OBSERVATION AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIELD WHICH OF THESE TESTS
RESULTS ARE RELIABLE AND WHICH ONES AREN'T GIVEN WHAT THE TECHNICIANS
WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY DID. NOW, IN SUMMARY WITH REGARD TO THE DNA, WE
WILL LOOK AT EACH ITEM, HOPEFULLY HAVE TESTIMONY REGARDING EACH ITEM,
HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME TESTIMONY REGARDING WHICH ITEMS ARE RELIABLE, ARE
NOT RELIABLE AND THEN GIVE YOU EVIDENCE BY WHICH YOU CAN MAKE A FINAL
DECISION. YOU WILL RECALL I BELIEVE THAT MISS CLARK IN HER OPENING
STATEMENT SAID THAT BLOOD CONSISTENT WITH NICOLE BROWN AND RON GOLDMAN
WAS FOUND ON THE GLOVE THAT THIS DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WE TALKED ABOUT
CLAIMS TO HAVE FOUND BEHIND MR. SIMPSON'S HOME. THAT GLOVE WILL BE
UNDOUBTEDLY, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, ONE OF THE MOST HOTLY DISPUTED
ITEMS IN THIS CASE. WHERE THE GLOVE WAS, HOW IT GOT THERE, WHERE IT CAME
FROM WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES. IN ADDITION TO THAT, THERE WILL BE A
MAJOR DISPUTE IN CERTAIN OTHER AREAS. I THINK YOU WILL HEAR A LOT OF
TESTIMONY ABOUT THIS SO-CALLED BLOOD FOUND IN THE BRONCO. YOU REMEMBER
THE BRONCO TIME LINE. YOU WILL HEAR A LOT OF TESTIMONY ABOUT WHETHER OR
NOT THE PROSECUTION'S CONTENTION THAT BLOOD CONSISTENT WITH -- NOT THEIR
BLOOD, BUT CONSISTENT WITH GOLDMAN AND NICOLE FOUND INSIDE -- NICOLE
BROWN SIMPSON INSIDE THE BRONCO, WHETHER OR NOT THIS FINDING IS
TRUSTWORTHY. WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE POLICE
TECHNICIANS WOULD USE UNRELIABLE PROCEDURES IN COLLECTING THIS, THEY
MADE FUNDAMENTAL ERRORS IN CONDUCTING THESE TESTS AND THEN
MISINTERPRETED THEIR OWN FINDINGS AS I INDICATED TO YOU EARLIER, THAT
THE STAINS THAT THEY THINK ARE CONSISTENT WITH GOLDMAN AND NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON CONTAIN TINY AMOUNTS OF DNA, SO LITTLE, THEY CAN BARELY BE
DETECTED. THIS DNA COULD ONLY BE FOUND USING THIS SUPER-SENSITIVE
PROCEDURE WE TALKED ABOUT WHERE EVEN A SNEEZE COULD CONTAMINATE IT. SO
EVEN IF THE TEST RESULTS WERE RIGHT, WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THE
DNA COULD BE FROM A TINY AMOUNT OF CONTAMINATING DNA FROM THE CRIME
SCENE FROM ANOTHER PERSON. FINALLY, IN THAT CONNECTION, WE THINK THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE DNA RESULTS THAT SUPPOSEDLY PUT NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON AND RON GOLDMAN IN THE BRONCO ARE NOT LIKE A FINGERPRINT AND A
MATCH DOESN'T MEAN THAT. THEY DETECT CHARACTERISTICS IN THE DNA THAT
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE, NOT CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO ONE
PARTICULAR PERSON. NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER THAN DNA FOR A
MOMENT. WHEN MR. SIMPSON CAME BACK FROM CHICAGO, I THINK THE EVIDENCE
WILL BE THAT HE CAME HOME IMMEDIATELY. HE CAME BACK VOLUNTARILY AFTER
HEARING ABOUT HIS EX-WIFE'S DEATH. YOU HAVE HEARD SOME INDICATION ABOUT
HIS DEMEANOR. ON HIS WAY BACK, THAT HE WENT -- CAME HOME, HE WAS ASKED
BY THE POLICE TO COME DOWNTOWN, THAT HE WENT DOWNTOWN, THAT -- WITHOUT
GIVING YOU WHAT THE STATEMENT WAS -- THAT HE COOPERATED FULLY AND THAT
HE GAVE THE POLICE A STATEMENT, PERHAPS SOME 33 MINUTES, WHICH STATEMENT
IS TAPE-RECORDED, THAT THE TWO DETECTIVES WHO INTERVIEWED HIM AT THE
TIME WERE DETECTIVES LANGE AND VANNATTER. HE ANSWERED ALL THEIR
QUESTIONS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT INTERVIEW, THEY ASKED FOR A BLOOD
SAMPLE. MR. SIMPSON WAS ONLY TOO PLEASED OR COOPERATIVE TO GO AND GIVE A
BLOOD SAMPLE AT THAT TIME. AND IF I MIGHT STEP OVER A LITTLE CLOSER,
THIS NEXT CHART -- MR. DOUGLAS, WHAT IS THIS CHART?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* NO. 205.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THIS CHART HOPEFULLY WILL GRAPHICALLY ILLUSTRATE WHAT
TOOK PLACE. REFERRING TO 205, WE HAVE PARKER CENTER. THIS IS LOS ANGELES
POLICE DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS DOWN AT 150 NORTH LOS ANGELES. THIS IS
THE BUILDING IN WHICH MR. SIMPSON GAVE THIS STATEMENT TO THE TWO LEAD
DETECTIVES FROM ROBBERY/HOMICIDE (INDICATING). HE WAS QUESTIONED AND HE
ANSWERED THEIR QUESTIONS. THEREAFTER -- AND THAT'S THE BUILDING DEPICTED
-- THERE'S THE LITTLE YELLOW CIRCLE DEPICTED THERE (INDICATING).
THEREAFTER, THEY ASKED MR. SIMPSON TO GIVE SOME BLOOD. A TECHNICIAN THEN
DREW SOME BLOOD FROM HIS ARM. WE THINK, ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY, IT
WAS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MILLILITERS OF BLOOD. THE TESTIMONY WAS BETWEEN
7.9 AND 8.1, WHICH I THINK IS EIGHT MILLILITERS OF BLOOD. NOW, WE THINK
THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW UNDER NORMAL POLICE PROCEDURES, IF THEY'D BEEN
FOLLOWING THEIR OWN PROCEDURES, WHEN THE DETECTIVES HAD THIS BLOOD IN A
VIAL, CERTAINLY MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AT THAT TIME, THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN
IT OVER, ABOUT A THREE-MINUTE -- A VERY SHORT DRIVE AND BOOK IT AT A
PLACE CALLED PIPER TECH. YOU WILL HEAR EVIDENCE ABOUT WHERE THEY BOOK
THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE, WHERE THE REFRIGERATORS ARE AND THAT SORT OF
THING, BOOK IT TO PRESERVE IT. YOU WILL HEAR THE IMPORTANCE OF
PRESERVING THAT BLOOD. WE THINK THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE WILL SHOW THAT
THE DETECTIVES DIDN'T TAKE THE BLOOD FROM SIMPSON AT ABOUT 2:30 ON
JANUARY -- ON JUNE 13TH, 1994. THEY DIDN'T GO THIS VERY SHORT DISTANCE
TO PIPER TECH AND BOOK IT. FOR SOME REASON, THEY CAME ALL THE WAY -- I
GUESS THIS IS SOME 20 MILES OR SO -- FROM DOWNTOWN L.A. WITH THE BLOOD
ON THEIR PERSON IN THIS VIAL, CAME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE TO THIS AREA
CALLED BRENTWOOD, THE HOME OF O.J. SIMPSON, 360 NORTH ROCKINGHAM AVENUE.
AND WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW DETECTIVE VANNATTER, WHO HAD THIS
BLOOD ON HIS PERSON, INSTEAD OF BOOKING IT AT PIPER TECH WHERE IT SHOULD
HAVE BEEN, CARRIED THIS BLOOD AROUND FROM 2:30 UNTIL PERHAPS 5:20 IN THE
AFTERNOON ON JUNE 13TH, 1994, WENT BACK TO MR. O.J. SIMPSON'S HOME. AND
THERE, WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE SOME TESTIMONY THE BLOOD VIAL HE HAD BEEN
CARRYING AROUND APPARENTLY IN HIS POCKET, HE THEN TURNED OVER TO MR.
FONG, WHO IS A SUPERVISOR OF THIS OFFICER IN CHARGE, THE TRAINEE AT THE
SCENE. AND THEN YOU WILL HEAR SOME INTERESTING TESTIMONY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENS WITH THAT BLOOD. THE BLOOD IS SUPPOSED TO BE NO. 17, BUT IT GETS
BOOKED AS NO. 18 AT SOME POINT. NO. 18 YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IS A PAIR OF
SNEAKERS. THAT SAME AFTERNOON, AT ROCKINGHAM, WE THINK YOU WILL HEAR
TESTIMONY THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER'S PARTNER, DETECTIVE LANGE, A MEMBER
OF LAPD SOME 25, 27 YEARS, TALKS TO MR. SIMPSON AFTER MR. SIMPSON COMES
BACK HOME, AND THEY ASK HIM, "WHAT SHOES WERE YOU WEARING LAST NIGHT,"
WORDS TO THAT EFFECT, AND THEY PICK UP A PAIR OF REEBOK TENNIS SHOES.
AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT KATO KAELIN HAD SAID
HE WAS WEARING I THINK WHEN HE GOES TO MC DONALD'S TO GET THE HAMBURGER.
THEY THEN TAKE THESE TENNIS SHOES. THE TENNIS SHOES ARE ULTIMATELY
BOOKED AS NO. 18. BUT FOR A WHILE AT LEAST, THE BLOOD IS ALSO NO. 18.
DETECTIVE LANGE I THINK WILL TESTIFY THAT HE TAKES THESE TENNIS SHOES
AND HE TAKES THEM HOME FOR THE NIGHT. HE DOESN'T GO BACK DOWNTOWN AND
BOOK THEM OR WHATEVER. HE TAKES THEM HOME AND BRINGS THEM BACK THE NEXT
DAY, WHICH WOULD BE THE 14TH. SO THIS IS MISLABELED, THERE'S CONFUSION
AS TO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS BLOOD AND WHO GETS IT. WE KNOW THAT THE
NEXT MORNING, FUNG HAS THE BLOOD DOWNTOWN, AND COLLIN YAMAUCHI, ONE OF
THE TECHNICIANS, TAKES ONE MILLILITER OF BLOOD OUT OF THIS PARTICULAR
VIAL. SO THIS BLOOD -- THIS IS THE STRANGE SAGA OF THIS BLOOD AND WHY IT
WAS CARRIED OUT HERE. WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW EXACTLY THE
EVENTS I JUST TESTIFIED TO OR JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT IN TESTIMONY. MR.
DOUGLAS.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* NEXT, YOUR HONOR, IS EXHIBIT 211.

*MR. COCHRAN:* NOW, WITH REGARD TO EXHIBIT 211, THIS EXHIBIT SEEKS TO
DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU AS BEST WE CAN USING THE PROSECUTION'S RECORDS. ALL
WE CAN USE ARE THE RECORDS. THESE ARE THEIR RECORDS. THIS IS WRONG MAYBE
BECAUSE THE RECORDS ARE WRONG. BUT DEFENDANT'S SAMPLE OFFERED
VOLUNTARILY. WE TOLD YOU THAT. THAT IS MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD. I'VE ALREADY
SHARED WITH YOU THAT HE HAD EIGHT MILLILITERS TAKEN ON JUNE 13. WE KNOW
THAT THE DETECTIVE WALKS AROUND WITH IT FOR AT LEAST THREE HOURS OR SO
BEFORE THE TECHNICIAN EVER GETS IT, ACCORDING TO THE RECORDS AS WE
UNDERSTAND. SO YOU START WITH THE EIGHT MILLILITERS. WE KNOW THAT ON
JUNE 14TH, I THINK THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT COLLIN YAMAUCHI TOOK
FROM FUNG ONE MILLILITER OF MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD. YOU HAVE TO -- WE'LL
HAVE TO SUBTRACT THAT AT SOME POINT. WE KNOW THAT SEVEN DAYS LATER, MR.
FLAGHERTY TOOK 1.5 MILLILITERS IN A TUBE, A SMALLER TUBE AS INDICATED
HERE, ULTIMATELY RETURNED EIGHT MILLILITERS FROM THIS TUBE. SO WE KNOW
THERE WAS .7 MILLILITERS USED OUT OF THE SMALLER TUBE THAT HAD BEEN
TAKEN ON THE 21ST. THEN ON JUNE 25TH, COLLIN YAMAUCHI AGAIN PUT SOME
BLOOD ON SOME THREADS FOR SOME PURPOSE AND HE USED ONLY .05 MILLILITERS
AT THAT POINT ACCORDING TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR EVIDENCE. THEN ON
JUNE 27TH, MR. MATHESON, AGAIN, ANOTHER ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS, TOOK .75
MILLILITERS OF MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD, ALL FROM THE SAME TUBE. AND FINALLY,
THE DEFENSE AT SOME POINT WERE GIVEN ONE MILLILITER OF THE BLOOD. AND WE
KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME BLOOD LEFT IN THE SMALL TUBE AND WE KNOW THAT --
AND A RECENT MEASUREMENT IN JANUARY -- I THINK ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 4TH
OF THIS YEAR, THERE WAS 1.8 MILLILITERS LEFT IN THE TUBE PLUS THE EIGHT
MILLILITERS RETURNED FROM THE SMALLER TUBE. AND IF YOU SUBTRACT THESE
PARTICULAR FIGURES -- AND I'VE DONE THAT -- SUBTRACT THE 1.0, THE .7,
THE .05, THE .75, THE 1.0, YOU WILL HAVE 3.50 MILLILITERS OF BLOOD
TAKEN. TO THAT, YOU HAVE TO ADD THE 1.8 LEFT AND THE .8 THAT WAS USED
THERE OR 2.60. SO IF YOU ADD THE 2.60 TO THE 3.50, YOU WILL GET 6.10
MILLILITERS OF BLOOD. AND SO THIS CHART -- AND PERHAPS MAYBE WILL BE
EXPLAINED TO US DURING THE TRIAL -- SHOWS THAT IF YOU STARTED WITH 8.0
MILLILITERS AND YOU USE 6.10 MILLILITERS, IT WOULD BE THEN 1.9
MILLILITERS MISSING ABOVE THE AMOUNT THAT'S LEFT, 1.90 MISSING. AND ONE
OF THE THINGS WE WILL BE LOOKING AT IN THIS CASE IS WHAT HAPPENED TO
THAT MISSING BLOOD AND WHERE IS IT. PERHAPS THERE ARE SOME RECORDS WE
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT WILL EXPLAIN THAT. BUT THOSE ARE THE RECORDS AS WE
UNDERSTAND IT, THAT THERE WILL BE 1.90 MILLILITERS OF MISSING BLOOD IN
THAT CONNECTION. A BIT MORE ABOUT THIS CRIME SCENE AND WHAT HAPPENED. WE
THINK YOU WILL SEE AND HEAR FROM THIS TRAINEE MAZZOLA AND WHAT SHE DID
AT THAT SCENE, HOW SHE SOUGHT TO COLLECT THESE SAMPLES, DETECTIVE FUNG'S
ROLE AT BOTH BUNDY AND AT BOTH -- ROCKINGHAM. I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO THEN MAKE A DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE OUT THERE ON THAT
DATE. NOW, ONE OF THE OTHER KEY BITS OF EVIDENCE WE EXPECT IN THIS CASE
WILL BE THE SOCKS THAT MISS CLARK TALKED TO YOU ABOUT IN HER OPENING
STATEMENT. REMEMBER SHE TALKED ABOUT THE SOCKS? AND I THINK THAT WITH
REGARD TO THE SOCKS, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A TIME LINE AND WE ALSO HAVE A
GRAPHIC WITH REGARD TO THE SOCKS ALSO. MAY WE HAVE THE GRAPHIC AND THE
NUMBER OF THE GRAPHIC?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* FOR THE RECORD, YOUR HONOR, THE CHART IS EXHIBIT 212.

*MR. HARRIS:* THE GRAPHIC IS D-84.

*MR. COCHRAN:* D-84. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. YOU WILL RECALL THERE WAS
SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT THIS. I THINK THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY DURING THE
COURSE OF THIS CASE THAT THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM IN MR. O.J.
SIMPSON'S HOME AT ROCKINGHAM (INDICATING). THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THAT
THIS PLACE IS USUALLY METICULOUS AND SPOTLESS. YOU WILL NOTE THAT THE
CARPET IS VERY, VERY LIGHT AND I THINK THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THE
CARPET IS EITHER WHITE OR VERY LIGHT THROUGHOUT, GOING UP THE STAIRWAYS,
IN THE HALLWAYS AND VARIOUS OTHER PLACES. AND YOU WILL RECALL THAT -- IN
THIS PICTURE, YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WHATEVER THIS STRAP IS ON THE BED IS
HANGING DOWN ON THE BED. I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER PICTURE WHERE THAT
STRAP HAS BEEN MOVED. AND OVER IN THE CENTER -- YOU'LL SEE IN THIS
PICTURE, THE SECOND PICTURE (INDICATING) -- MR. HARRIS, WHAT IS THIS?

*MR. HARRIS:* D-85.

*MR. COCHRAN:* IN THIS PICTURE, YOU DON'T SEE THE STRAP HANGING DOWN. SO
APPARENTLY IT'S BEEN MOVED. YOU WILL SEE A VIEW OF THESE SOCKS. THESE
SOCKS APPARENTLY BALLED -- KIND OF -- PART OF THEM ROLLED UP AND THEN ON
THIS CARPET OR RUG THAT'S AT THE FOOT OF MR. SIMPSON'S BED AND JUST IN
FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE, THE ONLY ITEM YOU FIND THERE. HERE'S A CLOSE-UP
VIEW --

*MR. HARRIS:* D-86.

*MR. COCHRAN:* -- OF THESE SOCKS WHICH WERE LOCATED THERE. AND THIS NOW
IS JUNE 13TH, THE AFTERNOON HOURS AT THE ROCKINGHAM RESIDENCE, THESE
SOCKS ARE LOCATED. NOW, THE TIME LINE I THINK IS HELPFUL TO US AS WE
CONSIDER AND LOOK AT THESE SOCKS. AGAIN, THESE SOCKS RECOVERED ON JUNE
13TH. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT. AND THEY'RE EXAMINED ON JUNE 13, AND THERE'S
NO MENTION OF BLOOD ON THESE SOCKS ON JUNE 13TH. WE KNOW THAT MICHELE
KESTLER, BASICALLY THE SUPERVISOR OF THE LAB OVER THERE AT LAPD, SHOWS
THESE SOCKS -- THEY CAN'T REALLY EXAMINE THEM -- TO TWO OF OUR EXPERTS,
DRS. MICHAEL BADIN AND DR. BARBARA WOLF. THEY SEE THE SOCKS ON JUNE
24TH. THAT'S WITHIN 11 DAYS OF THE SOCKS HAVING BEEN TAKEN BACK TO THE
LAB. IT'S JUNE 24TH. AROUND THIS SAME TIME, I THINK ALSO IN JUNE, MISS
MICHELE KESTLER I THINK MAKES SOME OBSERVATIONS OF THESE SOCKS AND AT
SOME POINT SEES SOME FIBER OR SOMETHING ON THE SOCKS. SO THERE'S AN
OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW TO LOOK AT THESE SOCKS, TO
BE ABLE TO OBSERVE THEM ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. THEN WE THINK THAT ON
JUNE 29TH, 1994, THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT KESTLER, MATHESON AND
YAMAUCHI DO IN FACT INSPECT THE SOCKS. THAT'S THE THIRD DATE IN THE SAGA
OF THE SOCKS. IT'S NOT UNTIL AUGUST 4TH, 1994 THAT ANYBODY IN THE LAPD
LAB SEES A BLOODSTAIN ON THESE SOCKS FOR THE FIRST TIME. NOW, THESE ARE
THE SAME SOCKS THAT YOU SEE UP HERE THAT ARE PICKED UP ON JUNE 13TH AND
SEEN ON THE 13TH, SEEN ON THE 24TH, SEEN ON THE 29TH. BUT YET, IT'S
AUGUST 4TH BEFORE A BLOODSTAIN IS SEEN ON THESE SOCKS FOR THE FIRST
TIME. AND THAT'S NOT ALL. WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT ON OR
ABOUT SEPTEMBER 22ND, 1994, THERE WAS -- WITHOUT TESTING ANY BLAME TO
ANYONE -- A FALSE LEAD TO THE PRESS THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S DNA HAD
BEEN FOUND ON ONE OF THESE SOCKS. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT FALSE LEAK WAS
THAT NO DNA TESTS HAD YET BEEN PERFORMED. SO THEY HAD PREDICTED THE
RESULTS BEFORE THE SOCKS HAD EVER BEEN TESTED FOR DNA. THEY WERE STILL
IN FACT AT THE LAPD LAB WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS.
THEN THE SOCKS AFTER THAT LEAK ON THE 22ND I BELIEVE -- AND THAT LEAK
WAS BY A LOCAL CHANNEL 4 REPORTER, WHO THEN RECONFIRMED THAT LEAK THE
NEXT DAY, ABOUT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S DNA ON THESE SOCKS. THE SOCKS
THEN WERE NOT EVEN SENT OUT FOR DNA TESTING UNTIL SEPTEMBER 26TH, SOME
FOUR DAYS LATER. THEN OF COURSE, LO AND BEHOLD, ON NOVEMBER 17TH, 1994,
THE LAB REPORTS, THEY FIND DNA ON THE SOCKS, NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S DNA
ON THE SOCKS, JUST AS THEY HAD PREDICTED IN THIS FALSE LEAK ON SEPTEMBER
22ND. AND OF COURSE, THESE ARE THE SAME SOCKS WHERE NOBODY SAW ANY BLOOD
AT ALL UNTIL AUGUST 4TH. AND THAT'S NOT ALL WITH REGARD TO THESE SOCKS.
YOU WILL HEAR THAT THROUGHOUT, THERE ARE VERY, VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF
THESE NANOGRAMS THAT YOU SAW ON THE CHART ON THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE.
THE NANOGRAMS FOUND ON THESE SOCKS IS MORE THAN 1400 NANOGRAMS, WHICH IS
AS MUCH AS ALL THE OTHER BLOOD TESTED IN THIS ENTIRE CASE JUST ON THESE
SOCKS. AND SO WE THINK THIS WILL BE -- THE EVIDENCE WILL BE, THIS WILL
BE A HOTLY CONTESTED ITEM AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THESE SOCKS WERE
CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND INTENTIONALLY TAMPERED WITH IN AN EFFORT, IN A RUSH
TO JUDGMENT TO GET EVIDENCE ON MR. SIMPSON WHERE YOU HAVE THE RESULTS
PREDICTED BEFORE THE SOCKS EVER ARE SENT OUT TO THE LAB AND THE AMOUNT
OF THIS DNA BEING EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF ALL THE REST OF THE BLOOD FOUND
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT IN ADDITION
TO THIS, YOU CAN SEE THIS AREA IS VERY, VERY, VERY LIGHT AROUND HERE.
THERE'S NO BLOOD FOUND ON THIS CARPET OR ON THAT RUG THAT'S AT THE FOOT
OF HIS BED, THAT THERE'S NO BLOOD FOUND ON THE LIGHT CARPET ON THE
STAIRS, IN THE HALLWAY FLOOR ON THE WAY UP. BECAUSE THE COURT HAS
INDICATED I BELIEVE THAT WE'LL HAVE A JURY VIEW IN THIS CASE, YOU WILL
BE ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELF HOPEFULLY AT SOME TIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE
THIS PARTICULAR AREA. YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF EXACTLY HOW IT LOOKS AND
WHAT TOOK PLACE. I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE LAPD DID IN FACT DO SOME
SEROLOGY ON THESE SOCKS AT SOME TIME, BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY
TO DO THE DNA THAT WAS PREDICTED. SO WE THINK THIS WILL BE SOMETHING
THAT YOU WILL FIND OF SOME GREAT AMOUNT OF INTEREST AND WILL BE A MAJOR
ITEM LITIGATED DURING THE COURSE OF THIS PARTICULAR HEARING. I MENTIONED
TO YOU EARLIER AS WE LEAVE THE SOCKS AND WHAT TOOK PLACE THAT I WANTED
TO BRIEFLY COMPARE WITH YOU THE CONDUCT OF O.J. SIMPSON WITH THE CONDUCT
OF THE OFFICERS, THE LAPD OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THIS CASE FOR THIS
GENERAL AREA OF JUNE 13TH. LET'S TAKE FIRST OF ALL MR. SIMPSON. WE
EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT MR. SIMPSON IS IN CHICAGO ON A
PREARRANGED LONG-STANDING TRIP FOR HERTZ TO PLAY GOLF, THAT HE GETS A
CALL FROM DETECTIVE PHILLIPS IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, THAT HIS WHOLE
DEMEANOR AND EVERYTHING CHANGED OF COURSE, AND HE COMES BACK
VOLUNTARILY. WHEN HE GETS BACK, HE COMES HOME AND HE MEETS WITH THE
DETECTIVES. THEY ASK HIM TO COME DOWNTOWN. HE GOES DOWNTOWN AND HE MEETS
WITH DETECTIVES WITHOUT ANY COUNSEL, THAT HE TALKS WITH THEM, THAT HE
GIVES THEM BLOOD, DOES EVERYTHING THEY ASK HIM, THAT HE THEN COMES BACK
HOME THAT AFTERNOON, JUNE 13TH IN THE AFTERNOON. MEANWHILE, THE
DETECTIVES -- AND WE'LL START WITH DETECTIVE PHILLIPS -- DELAYED ALMOST
10 HOURS BEFORE THEY GET THE CORONER OUT THERE. AND WE'VE ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT IN TRYING TO ESTABLISH THIS MAN'S
INNOCENCE. THEY THEN GO FROM THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE TO ROCKINGHAM. ALL
FOUR OF THEM, AS YOU KNOW, THEN CLIMB OVER THE WALL AND THEY MAKE THESE
MISREPRESENTATIONS TO THE JUDGE. SO IN THEIR VERY FIRST CONTACT WITH THE
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AT 10:45 ON JUNE 13TH, THEY DON'T TELL THE TRUTH
THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL, THEY KNOW HE'S ON A TRIP
THAT WAS PLANNED, AND THEY SAY AN UNEXPECTED TRIP. WE HAVE SHOWN YOU
THOSE THREE ITEMS EARLIER. THEY DON'T TELL THE JUDGE HOW THEY GET OVER
THE WALL OR WHATEVER. SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THEY PUT IN A DECLARATION
WHICH YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY SEEN ALREADY THAT DAY. THEY CONTINUE LOOKING
AROUND IN A MASS TO FIND EVIDENCE. WE'VE TALKED ALREADY ABOUT HOW PEOPLE
AT BOTH -- AT THE SCENE CERTAINLY AT BUNDY ARE TRAIPSING THROUGH THE
EVIDENCE AND THAT SORT OF THING. THEY LATER THAT DAY AFTER MAKING
CONTACT WITH MR. SIMPSON OR AT HIS HOME, THEY GO BACK DOWNTOWN WITH HIM.
THEY QUESTION HIM, THEY TAKE HIS BLOOD. INSTEAD OF TAKING HIS BLOOD AND
BOOKING IT LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE IN THEIR OWN PROCEDURES, THEY TAKE THAT
BLOOD AND COME SOME 20 MILES OR SO WEST BACK TO ROCKINGHAM, CARRY IT
AROUND, SEIZE HIS TENNIS SHOES, DON'T BOOK THOSE UNTIL THE NEXT DAY,
MISLABEL THE BLOOD -- IT'S TO BE 17. THEY LABEL IT 18. THE TENNIS SHOES
-- THE SNEAKERS ARE 18. THESE ARE THE EXPERIENCED DETECTIVES IN THIS
CASE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS CASE AS THE CASE PROGRESSES, WE WANT YOU TO
CHARACTERIZE HOW THEY CONDUCTED THEMSELVES AND HOW O.J. SIMPSON
CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN MAKING A JUDGMENT IN THIS CASE ON WHETHER OR NOT
THE PROSECUTION WILL EVER PROVE THIS CASE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.
THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF KEY WITNESSES IN THE CASE. WITHOUT GETTING
INTO ANY OF THEM, ALL WITNESSES ARE IMPORTANT. I THINK ALL SIDES WILL
AGREE THAT NO SIDE HAS A PRIORITY ON THE TRUTH, PRIORITY ON THE TRUTH.
ALL WITNESSES SHOULD BE ACCORDED, AS THE COURT HAS INSTRUCTED YOU, IN
LOOKING AT HOW YOU DETERMINE THE TRUTHFULNESS OF A WITNESS. YOU SHOULD
DO THAT. THERE ARE OTHER MISCELLANEOUS POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
AT THIS POINT WITH REGARD -- ONE OF WHICH IS WITH THE 911 TAPE. THE TAPE
I HAVE IN MIND NOW IS THE ONE FROM OCTOBER 25TH, 1993. I BELIEVE YOU
HEARD TESTIMONY THAT ONE OF THE OFFICERS WHO CAME OUT AT THAT PARTICULAR
TIME -- AND THIS IS THE TIME WHEN MANY OF YOU SAID DURING VOIR DIRE, YOU
HAD HEARD THIS PARTICULAR TAPE, WHEN THERE'S NO PHYSICAL INJURY OR
WHATEVER, THERE WAS A DOOR DAMAGED -- IT WAS ALREADY DAMAGED, BUT IT WAS
DAMAGED SOME MORE. MR. SIMPSON AGREES TO FIX THAT DOOR. YOU WILL HEAR
WHAT'S ON THAT TAPE WITH REGARD TO WHAT MR. SIMPSON HAS TO SAY AND WHAT
MRS. SIMPSON HAS TO SAY ABOUT HER INTENT AND HER THOUGHT. AND I THINK
WHAT YOU WILL FIND THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW, THAT THIS ARGUMENT, THE ENTIRE
ARGUMENT ON OCTOBER 25TH, 1993 WAS OVER PICTURE FRAMES OF FORMER LOVERS
OR LOVERS WHILE THEY WERE AWAY AND SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER AND NOT
HAVING BEEN REMOVED OR TAKEN OUT OF THE HOUSE AS THEY WERE STRIVING TO
GET BACK TOGETHER, AS YOU KNOW, DURING THE LATTER PART OF 1993. AND
ANOTHER AREA, IN LISTENING TO THE PROSECUTION'S OPENING STATEMENT, THERE
WAS CERTAINLY A SUGGESTION THERE MAY BE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE
NOISES, THESE THUMPS ON THE WALL IF YOU WILL THAT WERE HEARD BY MR. KATO
KAELIN SOMEWHERE AROUND 10:47 IN THE EVENING, THAT SOMEONE PRESUMABLY
CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE -- THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY I THINK THERE IS A
FENCE BACK THERE NEAR KATO'S ROOM -- AND ACCIDENTALLY DROPPING THE GLOVE
WHERE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN CLAIMS THAT HE FINDS THAT GLOVE OF COURSE LATER
ON IN THE MORNING. KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE WILL BE WE EXPECT TESTIMONY
FROM ROSA LOPEZ ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE AND VOICES OVER IN
THE SIMPSON COMPOUND 12:00 O'CLOCK ON UNTIL ABOUT 3:00 O'CLOCK SHE
HEARS. IT'S NOT O.J.'S SIMPSON'S VOICE OUT THERE. SHE HEARS PEOPLE
TALKING. SHE CAN'T GO TO SLEEP SHE SAYS. WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW
THAT THIS WALKWAY, WHICH IS VERY, VERY NARROW, IS VERY, VERY NEAR WHERE
SHE LIVES, KIND OF IN HER HOUSEKEEPER QUARTERS IN THE HOUSE RIGHT NEXT
DOOR. WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO BE THAT THE AREA WHERE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN
CLAIMS THAT HE FOUND THIS PARTICULAR GLOVE IS AN AREA THAT HAS A NUMBER
OF COBWEBS AND THINGS BACK THERE, WHICH ONE MIGHT INFER THAT PEOPLE
HADN'T BEEN WALKING BACK THERE, HADN'T BEEN BACK THERE FOR A WHILE. I
THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL ALSO SHOW THAT ON THAT SIDE OF MR. SIMPSON'S
HOME, IF MR. SIMPSON HAD WANTED TO COME HOME AND HIDE HIMSELF FROM
ANYBODY OUTSIDE, THE LIMOUSINE DRIVER, THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO ENTRANCES
TO HIS HOUSE ON THAT SIDE. THERE'S ONE DOOR THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT
GOES INTO A LAUNDRY ROOM, AND OF COURSE THERE'S A DOOR INTO THE GARAGE,
ALL ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE (INDICATING). I'M MAKING THESE STATEMENTS
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IN RESPONSE TO
WHAT THE PROSECUTION HAS INDICATED. I THINK YOU WILL ALSO FIND THAT
THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY THERE IS A GREAT AMOUNT OF VERY THICK SHRUBBERY
ON TOP OF THAT FENCE THAT SEPARATES THE PROPERTY WHERE MISS LOPEZ LIVES
AND WHERE MR. SIMPSON LIVES ON THAT DATE. AND I THINK YOU WILL HEAR
TESTIMONY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THOSE TWIGS, LEAVES OR ANY OF
THOSE ITEMS WERE EVER DISTURBED OR APPEARED TO BE DISTURBED AS THOUGH
ANYBODY HAD CLIMBED ACROSS OR CLIMBED OVER THAT FENCE. NOW I WANT TO
TURN OUR ATTENTION TO SOMETHING I ALLUDED TO THE LAST TIME. WE CALL IT
THE TIME LINE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE EXPECT TO SHOW DURING THE
COURSE OF THIS TRIAL IS NOT ONLY DID MR. SIMPSON NOT COMMIT THESE BRUTAL
MURDERS, BUT HE DID NOT, WOULD NOT, COULD NOT WITHIN THE TIME FRAME HAVE
COMMITTED THESE PARTICULAR KILLINGS OUT OF THE WITNESSES THAT BOTH SIDES
KNOW ABOUT THAT WE UNDERSTAND. AND WHAT WE HAVE IS A TIME LINE WITH A
CHART AND TIME LINE WITH THE GRAPHICS WHICH WE WOULD LIKE TO CALL TO
YOUR ATTENTION NOW. WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

*MR. HARRIS:* THAT IS D-87.

*MR. COCHRAN:* D-87. AND D-87 SO THAT YOU'RE CLEAR, THIS IS THE SIMPSON
COMPOUND. THIS IS THE HOME ON ROCKINGHAM THAT YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT
(INDICATING). THIS STREET OVER HERE IS THE -- CAN I GET THAT BACK? THANK
YOU, MR. HARRIS, SIR. THIS STREET OVER HERE IS THE ASHFORD STREET WHERE
ULTIMATELY ALLEN PARK WILL COME. THIS STREET OVER HERE IS THE ROCKINGHAM
GATE WHERE THE BRONCO WOULD BE PARKED. THERE'S A GATE RIGHT HERE, AND
THE BRONCO WAS PARKED RIGHT THERE (INDICATING). I INDICATED THERE WILL
BE TESTIMONY ABOUT WHEN THE BRONCO COMES OUT, HOW IT IS A SHARP TURN
RIGHT TO THAT LOCATION. AND OVER HERE, THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY WHERE
KATO KAELIN'S VEHICLE WAS PARKED, AND IN SOME OF THE SUBSEQUENT
PHOTOGRAPHS, I BELIEVE YOU WILL SEE THAT HIS VEHICLE IS PARKED HERE ON
ASHFORD ALSO (INDICATING). THANK YOU, MR. HARRIS.

*MR. HARRIS:* THIS IS D-108A.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AND THIS IS THE BUNDY RESIDENCE OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON,
AND I BELIEVE THAT 875 BUNDY IS RIGHT THERE. THIS IS THE WALKWAY THAT
DETECTIVE PHILLIPS TALKED ABOUT, RIGHT UP IN THAT WAY, A LOT OF
SHRUBBERY AND THERE'S A GATE THERE (INDICATING). TESTIMONY WAS YOU
RECALL OR HIS STATEMENT WAS YOU CAN SEE THE BODIES FROM THE STREET AND
THE GATE WAS OPENED. AND I THINK YOU SAW SOME PICTURES FROM THE
PROSECUTION DURING THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS. THIS IS BUNDY AND BUNDY --
AND THIS AREA IS A STREET THAT TRAVERSES NORTH AND SOUTH, NORTH BEING
THIS WAY, SOUTH BEING THAT WAY, WEST BEING HERE AT THE TOP AS I
UNDERSTAND IT (INDICATING). AND THIS IS THE AREA HERE WHERE THESE BODIES
WERE FOUND. THIS IS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S RESIDENCE. IT IS THE
RESIDENCE WHICH SHE HAD PURCHASED YOU WILL RECALL WITH THE FUNDS THAT
SHE HAD GOTTEN FROM THE MONEY THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD GIVEN HER BEFORE HE
MARRIED AND SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT HE HAD GIVEN HER. SHE HAD MOVED
THERE VOLUNTARILY. YOU HEARD THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO.
MR. DOUGLAS, WHY DON'T YOU PUT YOUR -- THERE'S A -- NOW, BEFORE WE GO
INTO THE TIME LINE -- WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE
ABOUT THIS WHEN WE DISCUSS SO-CALLED ALIBI TESTIMONY. ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW IN THIS CASE IS THAT MR. SIMPSON DOES
IN FACT HAVE AN ALIBI FOR HIS WHEREABOUTS ON THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT
DURING THE CRITICAL TIME. YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE PROSECUTORS IN THEIR
OPENING STATEMENT TALKED ABOUT A PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN 9:45 AND ABOUT
11:00. SO OUR EVIDENCE HERE THIS AFTERNOON WILL TRACK THAT SAME PERIOD
OF TIME, 9:45 P.M. UNTIL ABOUT 11:00 O'CLOCK P.M. AND YOU WILL RECALL
THE TESTIMONY THAT YOU'VE HEARD SO FAR THAT MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON
SPOKE TO HER MOTHER AND AN INDIVIDUAL AT THE MEZZALUNA RESTAURANT
CERTAINLY IN THE AREA OF 9:42 OR THEREABOUTS, HAD TWO PHONE CALLS IN
THAT PERIOD OF TIME. SO IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT SHE CERTAINLY WAS
ALIVE AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. SO THAT'S PROBABLY A VERY GOOD
STARTING POINT. WHAT YOU HAVE ON THE BOARD -- AND THIS NUMBER, MR.
DOUGLAS, WHAT IS THIS NUMBER AGAIN?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* 213.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THIS IS 213. THIS IS A SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW OF EACH OF THESE
RESIDENCES SIDE BY SIDE. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS, WE'RE GOING TO START
AT 9:45 AND IN EACH INSTANCE, FOR ROCKINGHAM AND FOR BUNDY, TELL YOU
WHAT WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW OF THE VARIOUS PARTIES AND WHERE
THEY WERE. LET'S TAKE THE GRAPHIC ON THE BOARD. AND WHAT'S THAT NUMBER,
MR. HARRIS?

*MR. HARRIS:* D-107.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU. AT 9:45 AT THE ROCKINGHAM RESIDENCE, MR.
SIMPSON'S, YOU'LL SEE IN THIS THING -- WE THINK THE EVIDENCE IS GOING TO
SHOW THAT KATO KAELIN IS IN HIS QUARTERS, MR. O.J. SIMPSON IS IN HIS
QUARTERS AND TO THE RIGHT HERE IS ROSA LOPEZ. AND YOU WILL SEE THIS
AREA. LET ME JUST USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE. HOLD IT THERE, MR. HARRIS. I
THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE -- ROSA LOPEZ
LIVES RIGHT OVER IN THIS PART HERE. THAT THERE IS THIS SIDE OF THE
HOUSE, LITTLE WALKWAY GOES RIGHT DOWN THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE BACK THIS
WAY, AND THAT'S WHERE DETECTIVE FUHRMAN CLAIMS HE FOUND THE GLOVE IN
THIS VERY, VERY SMALL AREA, LEADS BACK OUT HERE SOMEWHERE. AT 9:45 AT
THE ROCKINGHAM RESIDENCE, YOU SEE THE PARTIES WHO ARE THERE. MR. DOUGLAS
HAS CHARTERED THAT ON THE CHART HERE. YOU CAN SEE IT IN BOTH PLACES. MR.
HARRIS, NEXT.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-109.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AT 9:45 OR THEREABOUTS AT BUNDY, YOU WILL RECALL -- THIS
IS THE RESIDENCE RIGHT THERE ON BUNDY. AND WE KNOW FROM EXPECTED
TESTIMONY TO BE THAT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON HAD A PHONE CONVERSATION WITH
HER MOTHER AND SOMEBODY AT THE MEZZALUNA RESTAURANT ABOUT HAVING THE
GLASSES WHICH THE PARTY HAD LEFT AT MEZZALUNA. WE EXPECT SHE IS STILL
VERY MUCH ALIVE AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME. MR. HARRIS.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-110.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE'VE TAKEN THIS IN FIVE-MINUTE INTERVALS. AND OBVIOUSLY
THESE INTERVALS -- BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE FIVE MINUTES -- IS
NOT EXACT. THIS IS AS CLOSE AS WE CAN APPROXIMATE BASED UPON THE
EVIDENCE AS WE NOW UNDERSTAND IT. AT 9:50, PARTIES IN THE SAME RELATIVE
POSITIONS; ROSA LOPEZ, MR. SIMPSON, MR. KATO KAELIN STILL INSIDE HIS
RESIDENCE. 9:50 --

*MR. HARRIS:* 111.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 111, SAME SITUATION WITH REGARD TO BUNDY.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-112.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 9:55. AGAIN, NOW, KEEP IN MIND THAT THE TESTIMONY WILL BE
THAT ROSA LOPEZ AT ABOUT 8:15, BETWEEN 8:15 AND 8:30, HAS COME OUT,
SHE'S SEEN THIS BRONCO PARKED THERE. SHE WALKED HER DOG SOMEWHERE BACK
IN THIS AREA OVER HERE THAT I'M INDICATING WITH THE LIGHT AND SHE SEES
THE BRONCO KIND OF PARKED SOMEWHAT ASKEW. AND 9:55, THIS IS THE RELATIVE
POSITIONS THAT WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THE PARTIES AT ROCKINGHAM
AT THAT TIME (INDICATING).

*MR. HARRIS:* D-113.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 9:55, NOTHING ELSE HAS CHANGED AT THE BUNDY SCENE AT THAT
POINT. MR. HARRIS.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-114.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AT 10:00 O'CLOCK -- THIS IS AT ROCKINGHAM. AND AT 10:00
O'CLOCK, WHERE YOUR ATTENTION -- I THINK YOU WILL FIND THERE WILL BE
TESTIMONY THAT THE BENTLEY -- OF COURSE, THAT MR. SIMPSON AND MR. KATO
KAELIN HAD GONE TO GET THE MC DONALD HAMBURGERS, HAD PARKED IN THE YARD
THERE, THAT KATO KAELIN HAS TAKEN HIS FOOD BACK TO HIS ROOM TO EAT,
THEY'VE GONE SOMEWHERE AROUND 9:00 O'CLOCK, THEY GOT BACK SOMEWHERE
AROUND 9:37, 9:37 TO 9:40, SOMEWHERE IN THAT AREA. THE BENTLEY WAS
PARKED. MR. SIMPSON HAS EATEN HIS HAMBURGER. ROSA LOPEZ REMAINS AT THE
SAME PLACE. WE'VE DRAWN IN, BASED UPON WHAT WE EXPECT THE TESTIMONY TO
BE, THE CAR ON THE ASHFORD SIDE HERE, KATO KAELIN'S CAR. IT'S ALL IN
BLACK THERE. YOU WILL SEE OF COURSE THE BRONCO. THAT'S AT 10:00 O'CLOCK,
SAME AS WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW, AT ROCKINGHAM.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-115.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AT BUNDY AT 10:00 O'CLOCK, WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE
TESTIMONY THAT A MAN NAMED TOM LANG, SAME NAME AS THE DETECTIVE IN THIS
CASE, BUT NOT THE DETECTIVE, A WITNESS, WE THINK WILL TESTIFY THAT HE'S
OUT, AS SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD DO, WALKING HIS DOG DOWN
HERE, A STREET DOWN HERE CALLED DOROTHY STREET. THIS IS HIS DOG, AND
HE'S OUT WALKING THE DOG, AND THAT HE MAKES A STATEMENT TO THE POLICE,
WHICH HE TELLS THE POLICE THAT HE SEES A LADY THAT FITS THE DESCRIPTION
OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WEARING SOMETHING, A BLACK -- SOME KIND OF A
BLACK DRESS. THE DETECTIVE WHO TAKES THE STATEMENT DOWN, THE EVIDENCE
WILL SHOW, MISWRITES IT AND PUTS IT LIKE A WHITE FLOWING DRESS, BUT HE
TELLS THEM BLACK DRESS I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW. THAT HE SEES FROM
THIS LOCATION DOWN HERE, HE SEES THIS LADY WHOM HE BELIEVES IS NICOLE
BROWN SIMPSON EITHER TOUCHING OR IN SOME WAY EMBRACING SOMEONE AT A CAR
PARKED AT THIS CURB RIGHT ABOUT IN THIS AREA HERE, AND HE IS SOUTH OF
THEIR LOCATION AND HE SEES A GENTLEMAN AT THE CAR AND HE SEES NICOLE
BROWN SIMPSON. HE ALSO SEES -- HE SEES A MAN DESCRIBED AS A HISPANIC
GENTLEMAN STANDING ON THE SIDEWALK BEYOND WHERE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND
THIS GENTLEMAN ARE, AND HE IS STANDING WITH HIS FISTS CLUTCHED, AND I'M
INDICATING FOR THE RECORD, STARING DOWN AT MR. LANG. HE THINKS THIS MAN
MAY BE ANGRY WITH HIM BECAUSE HIS DOG IS LOOSE OR WHATEVER. SO THAT'S
MR. LANG AND THAT'S 10:00 O'CLOCK AT THAT -- AND THAT'S THE RESIDENCE
HERE. THAT'S 10:00 O'CLOCK AT THE BUNDY STREET LOCATION. AND IF MR. LANG
OF COURSE IS CORRECT, THEN NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON IS STILL ALIVE OF COURSE
AT THAT POINT. 10:05 AT THE ROCKINGHAM RESIDENCE, MR. SIMPSON HAS COME
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE. MR. SIMPSON I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW AT SOME
POINT MADE A TELEPHONE CALL SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 10:00 AND 10:05 TO HIS
THEN GIRLFRIEND, PAULA BARBIERI, ON A PORTABLE PHONE THAT HE HAD IN THIS
BRONCO. THERE WAS A PHONE CALL. HE WAS UNABLE TO HOOK UP WITH HER, BUT
HE DID IN FACT MAKE THIS PHONE CALL. I THINK THERE WILL BE RECORDS OR
WHATEVER TO THAT EFFECT. SO AT 10:05, THAT'S THE SITUATION THERE WITH
KATO KAELIN STILL BEING IN HIS ROOM AND ROSA LOPEZ STILL BEING IN HER
LOCATION.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-116.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:05, WE STILL HAVE THE SAME SITUATION AT THE BUNDY
LOCATION. WE HAVE TOM LANG STILL AT THIS SAME APPROXIMATE LOCATION.

*MR. HARRIS:* 117.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AFTER MAKING THE PHONE CALL AT THE ROCKINGHAM LOCATION,
WE NOW HAVE MR. SIMPSON BACK INSIDE. MR. SIMPSON VERY OFTEN WILL SWING
GOLF CLUBS, WHICH HE KEEPS ALL OVER THE PLACE, THE BENTLEY, IN THE
GARAGE OR WHATEVER I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE, AND THAT HE SOMETIMES
WILL CHIP -- THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOLFERS -- WILL CHIP OR SWING HIS FOUR
WOOD OR THREE WOOD GENERALLY IN THIS DIRECTION OVER HERE WHERE THERE IS
SOME SAND WHERE THE KIDS CAN PLAY AND THAT SORT OF THING (INDICATING).
DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME, MR. SIMPSON AT SOME POINT SWINGS HIS GOLF
CLUBS OR WHATEVER, AT SOME POINT, THIS POINT LATER AND CHIPS. SO HE'S
OUT IN THIS YARD AREA AFTER HAVING MADE THE CALL.

*MR. HARRIS:* THAT WAS D-118. D-119.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:10, NOT MUCH HAPPENING AT BUNDY THAT WE CAN TELL.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-120.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AFTER MR. SIMPSON HAS DONE THAT AND BEEN OUTSIDE MAKING
HIS PHONE CALL, I THINK YOU WILL FIND THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE
PARTIES, SIMPSON BACK INSIDE THE RESIDENCE. THE EVIDENCE WILL BE, HE IS
GOING TO CHICAGO. AT SOME POINT, HE HAS TO PACK, GET READY. KATO KAELIN
IS IN HIS ROOM. ROSA LOPEZ IS STILL AT HER LOCATION AT THAT POINT,
ALTHOUGH SHE'S JUST ABOUT TO LEAVE.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-121.

*MR. COCHRAN:* SAME SITUATION AT 10:15 AT THE BUNDY LOCATION.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-122.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THIS LOCATION AT ABOUT 10:15 TO 10:20, ROSA LOPEZ THEN
COMES OUTSIDE OF HER LOCATION TO WALK HER DOG AGAIN. AND SHE COMES OUT
THIS GENERAL AREA TO THE RIGHT HERE ON ROCKINGHAM (INDICATING) WHERE WE
EXPECT THE TESTIMONY TO BE THAT ROSA LOPEZ SEES THE BRONCO STILL PARKED
AT THE SAME CONFIGURATION, THE SAME LOCATION, JUST LIKE SHE HAD SEEN IT
BETWEEN 8:15 AND 8:30. SHE SEES IT BETWEEN 10:15 AND 10:20, THE SAME
LOCATION. AND THEN WE THINK SHE WILL ALSO TESTIFY SHE SAW THIS SAME
BRONCO PARKED IN THE SAME MANNER, SAME LOCATION, SAME CONFIGURATION THE
NEXT MORNING AFTER SHE HAD TALKED WITH DETECTIVE FUHRMAN. AND THAT'S
ROSA LOPEZ AT 10:20, THEREABOUTS AT ROCKINGHAM.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-123.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:20, CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD I THINK BY THE
EVIDENCE BY THE PROSECUTION, THAT THEY CAN DETERMINE DEATH BY THE
PLAINTIVE WAIL OF A DOG, WE HAVE SOME LIVE WITNESSES, ELLEN ARRONSON AND
DAN MANDEL -- THESE ARE TWO THAT I ALLUDED TO EARLIER -- WHO HAD BEEN
APPARENTLY ON THIS DATE TO MEZZALUNA, AND THEY'RE WALKING HOME AND
WALKING DOWN BUNDY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AT ABOUT 10:20. THEY WALK NORTH
TO SOUTH, THIS LOCATION AS I INDICATED HERE (INDICATING). THANK YOU, MR.
HARRIS.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-124.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AT THE OTHER LOCATION, AT ABOUT 10:25, WE EXPECT THAT
ROSA LOPEZ AT ROCKINGHAM CERTAINLY HAS GONE BACK INSIDE THE RESIDENCE
NOW HAVING WALKED THE DOG, MR. SIMPSON INSIDE THE RESIDENCE, KATO KAELIN
INSIDE THE RESIDENCE. AND WE HAVE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE LIMOUSINE
DRIVER, ALLAN PARK, COMES UP. AND IT'S INTERESTING -- IF YOU'LL BACK
THAT UP A MINUTE, MR. HARRIS. IT'S INTERESTING AT THE 10:25 LOCATION,
AND YOU WILL RECALL, BECAUSE I READ YOU THE TESTIMONY OF ALLAN PARK AT
BOTH THE PRELIMINARY HEARING AND THE GRAND JURY, WAS THAT HE DIDN'T SEE
OR DIDN'T LOOK TO SEE ANY OTHER CARS. MR. KATO KAELIN'S CAR WAS THERE.
HE DIDN'T LOOK TO SEE IF THE BRONCO WAS DOWN THERE. AND YOU WILL HEAR
EVIDENCE I'M SURE WITH REGARD TO WHETHER OR NOT -- WHAT ABOUT THE
STREETS AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT, 10:25, 10:30 ON A SUNDAY IN BRENTWOOD,
WHAT MIGHT YOU EXPECT TO HEAR, WHAT MIGHT -- WERE THERE LIGHTS ON, WHAT
WOULD BE OBSERVABLE AT THAT LOCATION. I BELIEVE HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE
ABLE TO GO OUT TO THESE SCENES AT NIGHT ALSO. SO WE HAVE KATO KAELIN'S
CAR, ALLAN PARK'S LIMOUSINE, THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE OTHER
PARTIES. WE'LL GO ON BACK TO BUNDY.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-125.

*MR. COCHRAN:* BY THIS TIME, ACCORDING TO WHAT I EXPECT THE TESTIMONY TO
BE, ELLEN ARRONSON AND DAN MANDEL HAVE CONTINUED WALKING SOUTH ON BUNDY,
AND NOW THEY'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE RESIDENCE THERE AT BUNDY. NOW, THE
IMPORTANCE OF THIS, WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, IS THAT THEY WALKED
THERE, THIS VERY SHORT DISTANCE, RIGHT TO THEIR RIGHT, IF THE CRIMES HAD
OCCURRED, WOULD BE THESE BODIES WITH THE GATE OPEN WITH BLOOD FLOWING
DOWN. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I READ THIS MORNING FROM PHILLIPS'
TRANSCRIPT, WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO THE CORONER ABOUT THE NEED TO COME
OUT HERE, THESE BODIES ARE RIGHT THERE, THEY CAN BE SEEN FROM THE
SIDEWALK OR FROM THE STREET. SO THESE PEOPLE ARE IN A RATHER UNIQUE
POSITION. AND I BELIEVE THAT THEIR TESTIMONY, THEY SAW NO BODIES, THAT
SAW NO GATE OPENED AT THAT POINT. AND IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 10:25 WHEN
THEY'RE WALKING AT THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION. SO THAT BECOMES -- THEY
BECOME, AS WITH ALL WITNESSES, VERY IMPORTANT. THEY BECOME PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT WHEN THE PROSECUTION TRIES TO PRESENT A THEORY THAT THESE
KILLINGS HAVE OCCURRED AT 10:15.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-126.

*MR. COCHRAN:* BACK AT 10:30, WHERE ROSA LOPEZ WENT BACK TO HER HOUSE,
EVERYBODY ELSE IN THEIR SAME POSITIONS. ALLAN PARK IS STILL OUT WITH THE
LIMOUSINE. IN FACT, PARK HAS AT SOME POINT GOTTEN OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE.
THE TESTIMONY WILL BE HE'S SOMEWHERE OUT HERE ON THE ASHFORD SIDE OF THE
RESIDENCE.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-127.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:30, I THINK WE NOW HAVE ROBERT HEIDSTRA, WHO WAS IN
THIS ALLEY I DESCRIBED FOR YOU BEFORE, AN ALLEY THAT RUNS PARALLEL TO
BUNDY. AND THIS WILL BE MEASURED FOR YOU, THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THIS
ALLEY AND BUNDY THERE. BUT HE ALSO IS OUT WALKING HIS DOG ON THIS SUNDAY
EVENING. HE'S WALKING IN THIS DIRECTION AGAIN APPARENTLY FROM NORTH TO
SOUTH, AND IT'S ABOUT 10:30 THAT HE FIRST APPEARS.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-128.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:35, THE SITUATION IS STILL PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AT
THIS POINT. THE LIMOUSINE DRIVER IS EARLY. THE ROLES OF THE VARIOUS
PEOPLE APPEAR APPROXIMATELY THE SAME 10:35.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-129.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:35. NOW, YOU WILL RECALL THAT ELLEN ARRONSON AND DAN
MANDEL HAVE WALKED PAST THIS LOCATION AT ABOUT 10:25, AND THEY DON'T SEE
ANY BODIES OR GATES OR ANY BLOOD. NOW, THIS MAN, ROBERT HEIDSTRA IS IN
THIS ALLEYWAY. I BELIEVE THE TESTIMONY WILL BE THAT AT 10:35 OR
THEREABOUTS, HE HEARS SOME UNUSUAL THINGS. HE HEARS THE SOUND, HEY, HEY,
HEY. HE HEARS I BELIEVE YOU WILL HEAR A GATE CLANG OR CLOSING. THERE
WILL BE TESTIMONY THERE ARE GATES BACK THIS WAY AT THE NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON RESIDENCE IN ADDITION TO THE ONE IN THE FRONT (INDICATING); THAT
HE HEARS THE SOUND OF MEN ARGUING I BELIEVE IS WHAT THE TESTIMONY WILL
BE. FROM THIS LOCATION, HE CAN HEAR THIS. HE HEARS THIS GOING ON. HE
HEARS THAT TO BE AT ABOUT 10:35 P.M. THAT'S AT THE BUNDY LOCATION. HE'S
IN THE ALLEYWAY AND HE'S APPROXIMATELY PARALLEL TO THE BUNDY LOCATION
EXCEPT HE'S IN THE ALLEYWAY OFF OF BUNDY. THIS IS AT 10:35.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-130.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE KNOW THAT, ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF MR. PARK, AT
SOME POINT, ABOUT 10:40 OR THEREABOUTS, HE PULLS THE LIMOUSINE AROUND.
HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET IN CONTACT WITH SOMEONE. HE PULLS AROUND UP TO
THE ROCKINGHAM GATE, WHICH IS ON THIS SIDE AS OPPOSED TO THE ASHFORD
GATE, WHICH IS ON THIS SIDE (INDICATING), AND THAT HE APPARENTLY GOES
BACK. YOU KNOW, HAVING HEARD HIS TESTIMONY, READ IT, BOTH THE
PRELIMINARY HEARING AND THE GRAND JURY, HE WAS NOT LOOKING FOR AND CAN
NOT TELL US EITHER WAY WHETHER THE BRONCO WAS THERE OR NOT. HE GOES BACK
TO THIS LOCATION, AND THAT'S ABOUT 10:40 OR THEREABOUTS ROCKINGHAM.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-131.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:40, WE HAVE MR. HEIDSTRA STILL IN THIS ALLEYWAY IN
THIS AREA. THIS IS APPROXIMATELY THE TIME, AT 10:40 P.M. JUNE 13TH, THAT
HE HEARS THIS CONFRONTATION SUPPOSEDLY WITH THESE MEN'S VOICES, SOUNDS,
ET CETERA, DISTANCE THAT HE'S AWAY.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-132.

*MR. COCHRAN:* ALL RIGHT. AT 10:45, THERE WILL BE TESTIMONY I BELIEVE
THAT ALLAN PARK IS UP TO THE GATE AT THIS POINT, THAT YOU SEE THE
LOCATION OF THE OTHER PARTIES, THEIR LOCATION. HE'S CLOSER TO THE GATE
WITH THE CAR RIGHT AT THE GATE. YOU SEE THE PARTIES -- THE POSITION OF
THE OTHER PARTIES AT THAT TIME. HE'S MOVED HIS CAR BACK FROM DOWN AT THE
ASHFORD GATE BACK AROUND. IT'S 10:45 OR THEREABOUTS.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-133.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:45, THIS IS THE JOURNEY OF MR. HEIDSTRA AS HE
CONTINUES DOWN THIS ALLEYWAY. YOU SEE WHERE HE'S GOTTEN DOWN AS HE'S
WALKING THE DOG. AND HE'S STILL WALKING PARALLEL TO THE RESIDENCE HAVING
MADE THE OBSERVATIONS THAT I'VE SHARED WITH YOU EARLIER.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-134.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:50 OR THEREABOUTS, MR. SIMPSON, THE EVIDENCE WILL
SHOW, HAS COME OUTSIDE OF HIS RESIDENCE, HAS GONE OVER TO THE BENTLEY AT
THAT POINT, LOOKED INSIDE THE BENTLEY. THIS LOCATION HERE, WHITE CAR,
WHITE INDICATION THERE, THOSE ARE THE BENTLEY AT THAT LOCATION. SIMPSON
IS OUTSIDE THE RESIDENCE. PARK IS OVER BY THE GATE. LOPEZ IS BACK IN HER
RESIDENCE. KATO KAELIN IS STILL SOMEWHERE BACK IN HIS QUARTERS
APPARENTLY AT THAT POINT.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-135.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:50, NOW AT THE BUNDY ADDRESS AND NO WITNESSES AT THIS
PARTICULAR POINT.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-136.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 10:55, NOW HAVE MR. SIMPSON I THINK BENT OR DID WHATEVER
HE WAS DOING IN THE AREA OF THE BENTLEY, GOING BACK OVER TOWARD HIS
HOUSE, TO HIS HOUSE TO GET HIS LUGGAGE AND COME DOWN TO GET READY TO
LEAVE. YOU HAVE KATO KAELIN COMING OUT PRESUMABLY BECAUSE HE'S HEARD
WHATEVER NOISES. HE'S NOW OUTSIDE OF THE LOCATION. ALLAN PARK IS STILL
OVER HERE. THERE IS SOME TESTIMONY THERE WILL BE SOME GOLF CLUBS OR
WHATEVER OUT HERE IN THIS AREA OF THE YARD, IN THIS AREA HERE
(INDICATING) ALL AT ROCKINGHAM. THIS IS APPROXIMATELY 10:55, JUST BEFORE
11:00.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-137.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THE SCENE REMAINS PRETTY MUCH THE SANE. ROBERT HEIDSTRA
IS NOW OUT OF THE SCENE HERE AT BUNDY.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-138.

*MR. COCHRAN:* 11:00 O'CLOCK, ALLAN PARK IS LET IN. THE TESTIMONY I
THINK WILL BE THAT HE STARTED TO LOAD THE LIMOUSINE UP, WHICH IS NOW
INSIDE HERE (INDICATING). KATO KAELIN IS HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH O.J.
SIMPSON ABOUT A NOISE HE HEARD. HE'S TRYING TO GET A FLASHLIGHT TRYING
TO TELL MR. SIMPSON ABOUT WHAT HE THINKS HE HEARD. MR. SIMPSON IS
RUSHING AROUND AT THIS POINT. AT SOME POINT, HE GOES BACK OUT, GOES TO
THE BRONCO AT SOME POINT, COMES BACK IN, GETS HIS LUGGAGE AND BRINGS HIS
LUGGAGE DOWN, A NUMBER OF PIECES OF LUGGAGE WHICH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT. AND
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE IN AND AROUND 11:00 O'CLOCK AND THEREABOUTS ARE IN
THIS PARTICULAR AREA HERE AS DEPICTED ON THIS EXHIBIT AT ROCKINGHAM. MR.
HARRIS.

*MR. HARRIS:* D-139.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THE SITUATION REMAINS THE SAME AT BUNDY. AND SO AT BUNDY,
THERE ARE NO OTHER WITNESSES AT THIS POINT. MR. HARRIS, IF YOU COULD GO
BACK TO ROCKINGHAM AT 11:00 O'CLOCK.

*MR. COCHRAN:* KATO KAELIN'S CAR REMAINS IN THE SAME PLACE. THE
LIMOUSINE IS NOW CLOSER IN THE ASHFORD GATE. THE BENTLEY IS STILL WHERE
IT IS, THE BRONCO STILL WHERE IT IS. MISS LOPEZ IS IN HER RESIDENCE.
KAELIN, MR. SIMPSON, AT OR AROUND THIS AREA WITH MR. PARK (INDICATING).
AS I'VE INDICATED, THIS IS THE TIME THAT THEY'RE PREPARING TO GO ON THIS
PRESCHEDULED TRIP TO THE AIRPORT TO GO TO CHICAGO. AROUND THIS TIME OR
THEREABOUTS, MR. SIMPSON HAS COME OUT, GONE OUT TO THE BRONCO AND HE
COMES BACK IN ALSO AT THAT POINT. NOW, I'VE TAKEN THIS FROM 9:45 UNTIL
11:00 O'CLOCK BECAUSE THAT'S THE TIME THE PROSECUTOR REFERRED TO AND
TALKED TO, AND I THINK IT PROBABLY IS THE VERY APPROPRIATE TIME FOR US
TO LOOK AT. IN DISCUSSING THIS, THIS PARTICULAR TIME LINE, TRIED TO
DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU THE WITNESSES THAT WE EXPECT WILL BE CALLED, WHAT
THEY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PERIOD OF TIME. IN LISTENING TO
THE PROSECUTION'S OPENING STATEMENT, THEY CLAIM THAT MR. SIMPSON LEFT
THE ROCKINGHAM LOCATION, TRAVELED TO BUNDY, KILLED TWO PEOPLE WITH ONE
KNIFE, HID THE KNIFE, HID THE BLOODY CLOTHES AND RETURNED TO ROCKINGHAM.
HE DID ALL THIS AT ABOUT 10:00 OR 10:15 AND GOT BACK THERE AT 10:25 OR
10:30 OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE, IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THAT'S
WHAT THEIR THEORY WAS. WE THINK THAT THEY HAVE FURTHER, BASED UPON THEIR
OPENING STATEMENT, COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO A THEORY THAT IN TRAVELING TO
AND FROM BUNDY, MR. SIMPSON HAD USED THIS BRONCO THAT YOU'VE HEARD SO
MUCH ABOUT. SO THEREFORE, WHEREVER THAT BRONCO WAS THAT NIGHT THEN,
ACCORDING TO THEIR THEORY, THAT'S WHERE MR. SIMPSON WAS THAT PARTICULAR
EVENING. WHAT WE TRY TO DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU AND WE THINK THE EVIDENCE
WILL SHOW, THERE'S NOT THAT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY, THERE'S NOT THE TIME
WHICH THEY CAN PROVE THAT MR. SIMPSON COMMITTED THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME, THE OPPORTUNITY NOR THE MOTIVE TO ESTABLISH
THIS. WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT HE DID NOT, COULD NOT AND
WOULD NOT COMMIT THESE PARTICULAR CRIMES. NOW, IN THE COURSE OF THIS
TRIAL, YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY REGARDING DOMESTIC DISCORD, DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE IF YOU WILL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. I TOUCHED UPON THAT BRIEFLY
THE OTHER DAY. WITHOUT BELABORING THE POINT, AS YOU HEAR THIS TESTIMONY,
I ASK YOU, AS WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE, KEEP AN OPEN MIND, TO REMEMBER THAT
THE INCIDENT JANUARY 1ST, 1989 WAS THE ASSAULTIVE INCIDENT THAT MR.
SIMPSON TOOK BLAME FOR, WROTE LETTERS OF APOLOGY. AND YOU WILL RECALL
THE TESTIMONY, WE EXPECT TO BE, SHE WAS NEVER STRUCK AFTER THAT IN A
PHYSICAL SENSE AND THAT IN FACT HE MADE AN AGREEMENT REGARDING THE
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT, THAT IF THERE WAS ANY PHYSICAL TOUCHING, THE
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT WOULD BE VOID. AT ANY RATE, THAT WAS NEVER DONE.
EXPECT TO SHOW THAT. THAT WITH REGARD TO THIS ENTIRE DOMESTIC DISCORD
EVIDENCE, THAT THERE WILL BE -- AND I ASK YOU TO BEAR IN MIND IN MANY
INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE PERSON PRESENT, PLEASE KEEP AN
OPEN MIND UNTIL YOU'VE HEARD THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE ALSO PRESENT AT
THESE INCIDENTS SO YOU CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THIS HAS ANY
BEARING AT ALL, BECAUSE IF YOU FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE, IF YOU BELIEVE MR.
SIMPSON COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT, THAT THIS TIME LINE IS SUCH THAT THERE'S
NO TIME FOR HIM TO DO IT, NO INDICATION THAT HE COULD HAVE DONE THIS,
THAT THE BRONCO WAS STILL THERE, WHATEVER, THEN THE CHARACTER EVIDENCE
WILL MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, BECAUSE HOW COULD YOU THEN PREDICT THAT
SOMEONE WHO GETS INTO A FIGHT WITH HIS WIFE IN 1989 WILL THEN KILL HER
IN 1994. ONE AREA THAT I DID NOT COVER EARLIER IS THE SEARCHING DONE IN
THIS CASE. THEY HAVE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE IN THIS CASE FOR WEAPONS AND/OR
CLOTHES, AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL BE THAT THEY SEARCHED EVEN IN
CHICAGO, IN THE FIELDS AND THE WOODED AREAS IN CHICAGO, ALL UP AND DOWN
ROCKINGHAM AND BUNDY AND EVERY PLACE THEY POSSIBLY COULD. THEY WORKED
VERY HARD ON THIS CASE BECAUSE IN THEIR RUSH TO JUDGMENT, THEY FIXED ON
THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY FOCUSED ON WE THINK THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID. MISS CLARK IN HER
OPENING STATEMENT SAID THAT MR. SIMPSON'S TIME WAS UNACCOUNTED FOR FROM
9:45 TO 11:00. I THINK YOU WILL FIND WHEN YOU HEAR THE EVIDENCE THAT
WHEN HE SPOKE TO THE POLICE, HIS TIME IS NOT UNACCOUNTED FOR. THE TIME
WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR --

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR --

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I CONCLUDE, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* WHY DON'T YOU APPROACH THE BENCH WITH THE REPORTER, PLEASE.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD AT THE BENCH:)

*THE COURT:* WE ARE OVER AT SIDEBAR. MISS CLARK, YOU HAD AN OBJECTION.

*MS. CLARK:* YES, YOUR HONOR. COUNSEL DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE
PROSECUTION IS GOING TO PRESENT THAT STATEMENT. AND COUNSEL FOR THE
DEFENSE CANNOT PRESENT IT BECAUSE IT'S HEARSAY AS TO THE DEFENDANT
UNLESS HE CAN TELL THE JURY RIGHT HERE AND NOW MR. SIMPSON WOULD TAKE
THE WITNESS STAND AND SO TESTIFY, UNLESS MR. COCHRAN --

*MR. COCHRAN:* I DON'T HAVE TO TELL THE JURY THAT HERE. YOU WANT TO KNOW
EVERYTHING IN MY MIND. JUDGE, IT'S CLEAR -- YOU AGREE WITH THAT. JUDGE,
I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE STATEMENT. I'M JUST GOING TO SAY WHAT SHE
SAYS, THIS TIME WAS UNACCOUNTED FOR. I'M PRIVILEGED TO SAY HE TALKED TO
THE POLICE. ALL I AM SAYING IS, HE TALKED TO THE POLICE AND I THINK THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW HIS TIME IS ACCOUNTED FOR.

*THE COURT:* BUT THE INFERENCE "TALKED TO THE POLICE" IMPLIES THAT
STATEMENT IS GOING TO COME IN. YOU CAN SAY THE EVIDENCE IS GOING TO SHOW
WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS TIME. IT'S A DIFFERENT
STATEMENT THEN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY. I'M NOT GIVING A STATEMENT,
JUDGE.

*MS. CLARK:* THEN I THINK THE REFERENCE TO THE POLICE SHOULD BE DELETED.

*MR. DARDEN:* I THINK WE SHOULD --

*THE COURT:* WE GET ONE GLADIATOR.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I'LL ADDRESS IT IN THAT FASHION, IF I MIGHT, SO WE CAN
TRY TO --

*MS. CLARK:* ALSO, YOUR HONOR, WHILE WE ARE AT SIDEBAR -- I DID NOT WANT
TO INTERRUPT MR. COCHRAN EARLIER, BUT HE MADE A BLATANT
MISREPRESENTATION ABOUT THE NATURE OF MY OPENING STATEMENT IN TERMS OF
TIME, REPRESENTING TO THE JURY THAT I SAID HE CAME BACK AT 10:15 OR
10:20, 10:30. I NEVER SAID ANY SUCH THING.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOU SAID THE KILLING WAS AT 10:15 AND HE HAD TO RUSH BACK.

*MS. CLARK:* HE GOT BACK -- 10:45 IS WHEN I SAID HE CAME BACK.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THAT'S YOUR THEORY, OKAY.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT'S WHAT I SAID. I'M JUST SAYING -- TELLING THE JURY THE
TRUTH.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR, COULD WE HAVE THAT CORRECTED?

*THE COURT:* NO.

*MS. CLARK:* COUNSEL WAS ALLOWED TO MISREPRESENT MY STATEMENT.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, THEY REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID AND THEY REMEMBER WHAT
HE SAID. THEY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. IF HE WANTS TO CORRECT THAT, HE'LL
PROBABLY GO BACK NOW AND SAY MAYBE I MISSPOKE MYSELF ABOUT THIS.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I CONTINUE, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU, COUNSEL. MR. COCHRAN, YOU MAY CONTINUE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU VERY KINDLY. NOW, I THINK WHEN WE STOPPED, I
WAS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE THAT WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT MR.
SIMPSON'S TIME WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND NOT UNACCOUNTED DURING THIS
PARTICULAR PERIOD FROM 9:45 TO 11:00 O'CLOCK. IN LOOKING AT MY REMARKS
THE LAST TIME I SPOKE TO YOU, I NOTICE THAT I MISSPOKE WHEN I SAID AT
ONE POINT THAT DR. CARY MULLINS HAD WON I THINK I SAID THE NOBLE PEACE
PRIZE, AND I THINK I MUST HAVE HAD DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING ON THE MIND
WHEN I TALKED ABOUT HIM. HE WON THE NOBLE PRIZE FOR CHEMISTRY. BUT WHEN
I WAS ADDRESSING YOU ABOUT THE PROSECUTION'S THEORY A FEW MOMENTS AGO IN
THIS CASE, I RECALL THAT MISS CLARK HAD INDICATED THAT SHE BELIEVES THE
TIME OF DEATH WAS 10:15 BASED UPON THE WAIL OF A DOG. AS TO THE TIME SHE
ALLEGES THAT MR. SIMPSON GOT BACK TO THE PREMISES, THAT WILL BE UP TO
HER TO PROVE AND I SUPPOSE THAT I SHOULDN'T SPECULATE WITH REGARD TO
THAT. NOW, I WOULD LIKE NOW FOR MR. DOUGLAS TO BRING SOME CHARTS UP THAT
RELATE TO CERTAIN JURY INSTRUCTIONS WHICH I THINK WILL BE VERY
APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO HAVE IN MIND AS WITH ALL OF THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS
THAT THE COURT HAS GIVEN YOU WITH REGARD TO THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE,
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT YOUR TASK OF RENDERING A DECISION NOW THAT
YOU HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF THIS EVIDENCE. WE WILL HAVE FOUR CHARTS THAT I
WOULD LIKE TO STEP DOWN AND --

*MR. DOUGLAS:* FIRST, YOUR HONOR, EXHIBIT 214.

*MR. COCHRAN:* NOW, THIS CHART IS 2.20, WHICH IS THE CALJIC -- THE JURY
INSTRUCTION. I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD IT. AND THE REASON I WANTED TO
POINT THIS OUT TO YOU AGAIN IS THAT WITH -- AS IN THIS CASE AND IN ALL
CRIMINAL CASES, THIS IS KIND OF A GUIDE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT THE WITNESSES
WHO GET ON THE WITNESS STAND TO HELP YOU IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT
YOU FIND THAT PARTICULAR WITNESS TO BE CREDIBLE OR BELIEVABLE IF YOU
WILL. AND THEY SET OUT CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT LOOK AT. YOU CAN
LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THE ABILITY OF THE WITNESS TO REMEMBER OR TO
COMMUNICATE ANY MATTER ABOUT WHICH THE WITNESS HAS TESTIFIED, CHARACTER
AND QUALITY OF THE TESTIMONY OF THAT PARTICULAR WITNESS, THE DEMEANOR,
HOW THAT WITNESS ACTS ON THE STAND, THE MANNER OF THAT TESTIMONY,
EXISTENCE OR NONEXISTENCE OF A BIAS, DOES THE WITNESS HAVE ANY INTEREST
OR BIAS IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE YOU LOOK AT. SO ATTITUDE OF THE WITNESS
TOWARDS THIS ACTION WILL BE THINGS THAT YOU WILL LOOK AT. AND THE COURT
HAS READ THIS TO YOU. THE CHARACTER OF THE WITNESS FOR HONESTY OR
TRUTHFULNESS OR ANY STATEMENT PREVIOUSLY MADE OR WHATEVER. THESE ARE THE
THINGS THAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO USE WITH REGARD TO REALLY TO ALL
WITNESSES CALLED BY THE PROSECUTION OR THE DEFENSE. REMEMBER, NO SIDE
HAS A CLAIM TO THE TRUTH IN THIS CASE AS WE GO ABOUT THIS SEARCH FOR
TRUTH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THE NEXT JURY INSTRUCTION, AND THAT IS
NUMBER -- MR. DOUGLAS, THE NUMBER? WE WILL GET THE NUMBER, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* 215.

*MR. COCHRAN:* NUMBER 215. AND NUMBER 215 IS THE SO-CALLED ALIBI
INSTRUCTION. AND YOU WILL RECALL THAT I ASKED YOU IN VOIR DIRE A LONG
TIME AGO THAT YOU WOULD NOT PUT ANY BAD CONNOTATION ON THE TERM "ALIBI"
IF THAT'S WHAT THE LAW CALLED IT. THAT NO MATTER WHO IS CHARGED WITH A
PARTICULAR OFFENSE, IF YOU WERE SOMEPLACE ELSE, CAN PRODUCE EVIDENCE
THAT YOU WERE SOMEPLACE ELSE, THE LAW CALLS THAT AN ALIBI. AND
ESSENTIALLY THIS INSTRUCTION SAYS THAT: THE DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE --
ACTUALLY WE'LL BE INTRODUCING OR EXPECT TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE FOR THE
PURPOSE OF SHOWING THAT HE WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE TIME AND PLACE OF THE
COMMISSION OF THE ALLEGED CRIMES IN THIS CASE FOR WHICH HE'S HERE ON TRIAL.

"IF, AFTER CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE EVIDENCE, YOU HAVE A REASONABLE
DOUBT THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME THE CRIME WAS
COMMITTED, YOU MUST FIND HIM NOT GUILTY." NOW, AGAIN, THIS INSTRUCTION
IS IMPORTANT AS ALL THE REST. BUT THE ALIBI INSTRUCTION, IF WE ESTABLISH
THE ALIBI TO YOUR SATISFACTION, HE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO AN ACQUITTAL
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE
COMING MONTHS AS YOU LISTEN TO THIS EVIDENCE.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* EXHIBIT 216.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, MR. DOUGLAS. YOU WILL RECALL ALL THE EXAMPLES
WE ASKED DURING VOIR DIRE AGAIN REGARDING DIRECT AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE. WELL, IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THIS IS A CASE THAT WILL REST
PRIMARILY ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT EVIDENCE
IS. AND THERE'S A JURY INSTRUCTION THAT APPLIES TO THAT THAT'S EXTREMELY
APPROPRIATE, AND I THINK -- I APPLAUD JUDGE ITO FOR HAVING GIVEN YOU
THIS INSTRUCTION EARLY ON BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT FOR
YOU TO BE AWARE OF THIS AS YOU CONSIDER THIS EVIDENCE, ESPECIALLY
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND HOW IT WILL BE APPLIED AT THE VERY END OF
THIS PARTICULAR CASE. THIS IS PART OF THAT INSTRUCTION, AND THE RELEVANT
PORTIONS WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS, THAT:

"A FINDING OF GUILT AS TO ANY CRIME MAY NOT BE BASED ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE UNLESS THE PROVED CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT ONLY, ONE, CONSISTENT
WITH THE THEORY THAT THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OF THE CRIME, BUT CANNOT BE
RECONCILED WITH ANY OTHER RATIONAL CONCLUSION.

"FURTHER, EACH FACT WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO COMPLETE A SET OF
CIRCUMSTANCES NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE DEFENDANT'S GUILT MUST BE
PROVED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. IN OTHER WORDS, BEFORE AN INFERENCE
ESSENTIAL TO ESTABLISH GUILT MAY BE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN PROVED BEYOND A
REASONABLE DOUBT, EACH FACT OR CIRCUMSTANCE UPON WHICH SUCH INFERENCE
NECESSARILY RESTS MUST BE PROVED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.

"ALSO, IF THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AS TO ANY PARTICULAR COUNT --"
THERE ARE TWO COUNTS HERE.

"-- SUSCEPTIBLE TO TWO REASONABLE INTERPRETATIONS, ONE OF WHICH POINTS
TO THE DEFENDANT'S GUILT AND THE OTHER TO HIS INNOCENCE, YOU MUST ADOPT
THAT INTERPRETATION WHICH POINTS TO THE DEFENDANT'S INNOCENCE AND REJECT
THAT INTERPRETATION WHICH POINTS TO HIS GUILT." SO IF AFTER YOU LISTEN
TO THIS EVIDENCE, AS WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW, THAT YOU HAVE A
BELIEF THAT MR. SIMPSON IS NOT OR DID NOT GO BACK OVER TO THAT LOCATION,
GO TO THE LOCATION, THAT HE WAS NEVER BUNDY -- STRIKE THAT -- THAT HIS
BRONCO NEVER LEFT THE PREMISES THAT NIGHT --

*MS. CLARK:* OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. THIS IS ALL ARGUMENT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WELL, LET ME PHRASE IT A DIFFERENT WAY.

*THE COURT:* PLEASE.

*MS. CLARK:* THE BALANCE OF THE INSTRUCTION WAS NOT READ TO THE JURY.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I WAS GOING TO GET TO THAT. IF AFTER YOU'VE HEARD ALL THE
EVIDENCE -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IS -- YOU WILL
THEN BE IN A POSITION TO MAKE A JUDGMENT AS TO WHETHER IT APPLIES TO
THIS PARTICULAR POINT, WITHOUT ARGUING WHAT IT IS NOW. WE'LL HAVE A
CHANCE TO ARGUE IT AT A LATER TIME. THE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE AT THIS
POINT IS FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS INSTRUCTION WOULD BE AS THE
COURT HAS. AND LASTLY, AS MISS CLARK POINTED OUT:

"IF ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE INTERPRETATION OF SUCH EVIDENCE APPEARS TO
YOU TO BE REASONABLE AND THE OTHER INTERPRETATION TO BE UNREASONABLE,
YOU MUST ACCEPT THE REASONABLE INTERPRETATION AND REJECT THE
UNREASONABLE." IT SEEMS REASONABLE, DOESN'T IT? THE POINT IS THAT YOU,
NO ONE ELSE, WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE JUDGES OF THE FACTS AND THE
WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE. THAT'S A DETERMINATION THAT YOU MUST MAKE, AND
NO ONE CAN TELL YOU WHAT TO MAKE IN THAT REGARD. AND EACH OF YOU IN VOIR
DIRE HAS PROMISED TO GIVE US YOUR INDIVIDUAL OPINION IN DOING THAT. AND
THE LAST JURY INSTRUCTION --

*MR. DOUGLAS:* EXHIBIT 217, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. COCHRAN:* -- IS THE SO-CALLED PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, REASONABLE
DOUBT, BURDEN OF PROOF INSTRUCTION. IT'S THE LAST INSTRUCTION I WANT TO
LEAVE WITH YOU TODAY.

"A DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL ACTION IS PRESUMED TO BE INNOCENT UNTIL THE
CONTRARY IS PROVED AND IN A CASE OF REASONABLE DOUBT WHETHER HIS GUILT
IS SATISFACTORILY SHOWN, HE IS ENTITLED TO A VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY. THIS
PRESUMPTION OF COURSE," AS YOU KNOW, "PLACES UPON THE PEOPLE THE BURDEN
OF PROVING HIM GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT." AND:

"REASONABLE DOUBT HAS BEEN DEFINED AS FOLLOWS: IT IS NOT A MERE POSSIBLE
OR IMAGINARY DOUBT BECAUSE EVERYTHING RELATING TO HUMAN AFFAIRS
DEPENDING UPON -- THAT EVERYTHING RELATED TO HUMAN AFFAIRS IS OPEN TO
SOME POSSIBLE OR IMAGINARY DOUBT. IT IS THAT STATE OF THE CASE WHERE
AFTER THE ENTIRE COMPARISON AND CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE EVIDENCE LEAVES
THE MINDS OF THE JURORS IN THAT CONDITION THAT THEY CANNOT SAY THEY FEEL
AN ABIDING CONVICTION OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHARGE." NOW, THAT'S WHAT
REASONABLE DOUBT IS IN THIS CASE, IN EVERY CASE. AND I WANTED TO MAKE
SURE THAT YOU AGAIN WERE AWARE OF THAT AS YOU LISTEN TO THIS CASE. THIS
IS A MURDER CASE WITH TWO CHARGES, TWO COUNTS. THIS IS NOT A DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE CASE. NOW, AS WE CONCLUDE FINALLY, AS I PROMISED YOU TODAY, I
BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT -- MAY WE APPROACH, YOUR HONOR? MAY
WE APPROACH?

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD AT THE BENCH:)

*THE COURT:* WE ARE AT SIDEBAR. MR. COCHRAN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I WAS GOING TO INDICATE THAT THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE OF
SUSPICIOUS THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO MR. SIMPSON IN THE MONTH BEFORE
THIS INCIDENT THAT I WAS GOING TO ALLUDE TO BRIEFLY NOW. I THOUGHT I
WOULD TELL COUNSEL WHAT IT WAS. AND THEY ARE, ON MAY 8, ON HIS WAY DOWN
TO ORANGE COUNTY, HE WAS SURROUNDED BY THREE DIFFERENT CARS. ONE PULLED
BEHIND HIM, ONE PULLED RIGHT BESIDE, ONE PULLED IN FRONT OF HIM IN AN
EFFORT HE THOUGHT TO CARJACK HIM. BUT HE HELD UP HIS CELLULAR PHONE AND
FINALLY THESE PEOPLE SPED AWAY. THAT ON JUNE 11TH, AFTER BEING AT A
CHARITABLE DINNER, HE CAME HOME AFTER HAVING HIS ALARM OFF, AND HE --
LEAVING WITH HIS ALARM OFF, HE FOUND HIS KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. AND FOR A
CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME, HE HAD BEEN FINDING -- HAD BEEN RECEIVING
NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS GENERALLY IN SPANISH OR A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, SO MUCH
SO THAT ON JUNE 2ND, HE HAD REQUESTED AND HAD ARRANGED TO HAVE THIS STAR
69 PUT ON HIS PHONE THERE AT THE ROCKINGHAM RESIDENCE SO YOU CAN FIND
OUT WHO'S CALLING YOU. THESE ITEMS, I WAS GOING TO LAUNCH INTO THAT JUST
BRIEFLY. I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT --

*MS. CLARK:* DOES COUNSEL INTEND TO PROVE ANY OF THE ABOVE WITHOUT
CALLING MR. SIMPSON?

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE WILL BE CALLING KATHY RANDA, WHO IS ON EVERYBODY'S
WITNESS LIST. SHE IS THE ONE WHO IN FACT ORDERED THE STAR 69. WITH
REGARD TO THE INCIDENT DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY, HE WENT ON DOWN THERE,
TOLD YOUR STAR WITNESSES, THE BROWN'S, ABOUT HAVING BEEN ALMOST ABDUCTED
OR CARJACKED.

*MS. CLARK:* YOU ARE SAYING --

*MR. COCHRAN:* LET ME FINISH -- CARJACKED OR -- AND WITH REGARD TO THE
INCIDENT ON JUNE 11TH, WHEN HE CAME HOME, HIS CHILDREN -- BECAUSE HE
TALKED TO EVERYBODY ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE DOOR OF THE KITCHEN WAS
OPEN, SO THE CHILDREN ARE ALSO AWARE OF IT.

*MS. CLARK:* MORE HEARSAY.

*THE COURT:* IF THE CHILDREN ARE INDEPENDENTLY AWARE OF IT --

*MR. COCHRAN:* THEY ARE INDEPENDENTLY AWARE.

*THE COURT:* -- OTHER THAN STATEMENTS BY THE DEFENDANT, THEY CAN TESTIFY
TO THE FACT OF -- WELL, MAYBE.

*MR. DARDEN:* WHERE IS THE DISCOVERY ON THAT?

*MS. CLARK:* WHERE IS THE DISCOVERY ON THAT?

*MR. COCHRAN:* I HAVE NO REPORT ON THAT.

*MS. CLARK:* ON WHAT THE KIDS SAW?

*MR. COCHRAN:* I HAVE NO REPORT ON THAT. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THESE KIDS
SAW, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY DISCOVERY ON THAT.

*MS. CLARK:* WHY NOT?

*MR. COCHRAN:* WELL, WE LIVE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD. I DON'T HAVE DISCOVERY.

*THE COURT:* HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET IN UNLESS YOUR CLIENT TESTIFIES
ABOUT THE CARJACKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN ADMISSION.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THE CARJACKING I THINK --

*THE COURT:* THEY WOULD HAVE TO OFFER IT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WELL, HE DID APPROACH SOMEBODY AND TALK ABOUT IT, BUT I'M
NOT SURE I CAN GET THAT PERSON -- AT A MALL IN ORANGE COUNTY. BUT I'M
NOT SURE I CAN GET THAT PERSON.

*THE COURT:* WHY DON'T YOU STAY AWAY FROM THAT STUFF.

*MR. DARDEN:* STAY AWAY FROM ALL OF IT.

*THE COURT:* UNLESS YOU CAN --

*MR. COCHRAN:* EVEN ABOUT THE PHONE?

*THE COURT:* THE PHONE, STAR 69, KATHY RANDA, IF SHE'S THE ONE THAT
ACTUALLY ORDERED THAT, SHE COULD TESTIFY TO THAT.

*MS. CLARK:* BUT SHE CAN'T TESTIFY TO WHY BECAUSE IT'S IRRELEVANT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* IT'S NOT IRRELEVANT.

*THE COURT:* SHE CAN TESTIFY THAT AT MR. SIMPSON'S REQUEST, IT GOT PUT
ON THE PHONE. THAT'S ALL SHE CAN TESTIFY TO.

*MS. CLARK:* ACTUALLY, SHE CAN'T TESTIFY, YOUR HONOR, TO THE FACT IT WAS
MR. SIMPSON'S REQUEST. THAT'S HEARSAY.

*THE COURT:* I'M SURE SHE CAN.

*MS. CLARK:* NO. WHAT I MEAN IS --

*THE COURT:* THERE'S AN EXCEPTION BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS WHY YOU DID
SOMETHING, NON-HEARSAY PURPOSE.

*MS. CLARK:* RIGHT. BUT IN THAT CONTEXT THOUGH, WOULD SHE BE PERMITTED
TO TESTIFY WHAT HE TOLD HER, AS TO --

*THE COURT:* NO.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. WE EXPECT ALSO THAT THERE WILL BE
EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY THAT A SHORT TIME BEFORE MR. SIMPSON WENT TO
CHICAGO, ON SUNDAY EVENING, JUNE 12TH, I THINK ON OR ABOUT JUNE 2ND, HIS
SECRETARY AT HIS REQUEST ORDERED THE STAR 69 FEATURE AT HIS REQUEST ON
HIS PHONE, AND WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT
AND AS TO WHY THAT WAS. IN SUMMARY, AS YOU THEN LOOK AT ALL OF THE
EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT O.J.
SIMPSON, AS YOU SEE HIM THERE, IS NOT A PERFECT HUMAN BEING. HE, LIKE
ALL OF US, HAS MADE MISTAKES. OF COURSE, WE KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE
PERFECT PERSON WHO EVER WALKED THE EARTH. WE THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL
SHOW HE'S NOT GUILTY OF THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES, THAT HE HAS BEEN BLESSED
BOUNTIFULLY BY GOD AND HE'S SHARED HIS LARGESSE AND BLESSINGS WITH MANY,
MANY PEOPLE; THAT IN THIS INSTANCE, THE PROSECUTOR'S THEORY THAT THERE
WAS ONLY ONE MURDERER IS JUST A THEORY. WE EXPECT TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE
TO SHOW THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE KILLER, THAT THE PROSECUTOR'S THEORY
WILL BE OVERCOME BY THE FACTS WHICH WE PRESENT. WE ALSO EXPECT THAT THE
EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT THE REASON THE PROSECUTION MAINTAINS THERE'S
ONLY ONE KILLER IS THAT MR. SIMPSON -- WHO THEY WANT TO PORTRAY AS A
STALKER, AND STALKERS DON'T COME IN PAIRS. IT COULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON
UNDER THAT SCENARIO. THAT EX-HUSBANDS WHO ARE STALKERS DON'T COME IN
PAIRS AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE WEDDED TO THIS ONE MURDERER THEORY, EVEN
CONTRARY TO WHAT THEIR OWN CORONER MAY VERY WELL INDICATE. I'VE SHARED
WITH YOU ALSO THE FACT OF MR. GOLDMAN'S JOURNEY THAT EVENING WHEN HE
CHECKED OUT AND WENT HOME, CHANGED CLOTHES AND EVERYTHING. SO I WILL NOT
BELABOR THAT. EXPECT THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW YOU GET INTO 875
SOUTH BUNDY, WHEN ONE COMES UP AND RINGS THE BELL OR WHATEVER AND HOW
YOU GET IN FROM THE HOUSE OR WHETHER THAT'S POSSIBLE, WHETHER SOMEBODY
HAS TO LET YOU IN OR HOW YOU GET IN THE PARTICULAR RESIDENCE. I ALREADY
TOLD YOU, WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE OF THE SIZE OF THIS AREA. AND
I THINK MISS CLARK HAS INDICATED AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IT'S
A VERY, VERY SMALL AREA, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE WILL SHOW THAT THE
POLICE WHO CAME OVER TO BUNDY YOU WILL SEE WALKING THROUGH THAT SCENE
WENT IN THAT HOUSE AND DIDN'T TAKE ONE PICTURE, PICTURE. THEY WENT IN
THE HOUSE, THAT THEY FOUND CANDLES BURNING AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS,
THAT THE INVESTIGATION INSIDE THAT HOUSE WAS SHODDY AND SCARCE IF AT ALL
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SO WHEN THIS CASE -- AS WITH MANY CASES,
YOU WILL RECALL THAT WE TALKED TO YOU A LOT ABOUT TRUTH AND YOUR COMMON
SENSE. DURING VOIR DIRE, I THINK WE -- ALL OF US TOLD YOU THAT WE WANTED
YOU TO USE YOUR COLLECTIVE COMMON SENSE AND DON'T LEAVE IT OUTSIDE IN
THE HALLWAY, TO BRING IT IN AND APPLY IT TO THE FACTS OF THIS PARTICULAR
CASE. IN APPLYING THAT COMMON SENSE, AS I INDICATED TO YOU, YOU WILL
LOOK AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THIS SMALL AREA. YOU WILL SEE THE FIGHT
THAT MR. GOLDMAN PUT UP. YOU WILL SEE THE INJURIES THAT HE SUSTAINED.
YOU WILL HEAR THE TESTIMONY ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD TO BE EXPECTED ON
THE PERPETRATOR. YOU HAVE SEEN MR. SIMPSON'S BODY, THE LACK OF SCRATCHES
THEREON. YOU WILL SEE AND YOUR COMMON SENSE WILL ADDRESS BASED UPON THE
EVIDENCE THE ISSUE OF WHETHER ONE PERSON COULD KILL TWO PEOPLE UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT HEARING SCREAMING AND A LOT OF RUNNING AND
ALL SORT OF THINGS. WE EXPECT HOPEFULLY THAT THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY
THE DEFENSE WILL HELP TO PROVIDE SOME ANSWERS TO THESE COMMON-SENSE
QUESTIONS. WE EXPECT ALSO THAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM A WITNESS BY THE NAME
OF PAULA BARBIERI. BOTH SIDES ARE AWARE OF HER. AND SHE WILL TESTIFY
ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. O.J. SIMPSON, SPECIFICALLY, AS I
MENTIONED EARLIER, BETWEEN THE PERIOD MAY OF 1992 AND MAY OF 1993 AND
MAY OF 1994 TO THE PRESENT. THIS CASE REALLY BOILS DOWN TO A WHO DONE
IT, THIS CASE IS ABOUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR WHATEVER.
IT'S ABOUT WHO KILLED THESE TWO PEOPLE AND THESE PARTICULAR HORRIBLE
CRIMES. THE PROSECUTION WILL PROBABLY START OFF WITH DOMESTIC DISCORD
EVIDENCE. AND THAT WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE, WE ASK YOU TO KEEP AN OPEN
MIND. YOU KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU KNOW THERE ARE GENERALLY TWO SIDES
TO EVERY SITUATION. WE CANNOT CALL OUR WITNESSES UNTIL WE GET OUR TIME
IN THE PART OF THE CASE WHEN IT'S OUR TIME TO PUT THE WITNESSES ON.
THAT'S WHY I'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME IN THIS OPENING STATEMENT TO TRY TO
DETAIL FOR YOU WHAT WE EXPECT THE EVIDENCE TO BE AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO
SHOW. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE FACT THAT SOMEONE HAS AN ALTERCATION WITH
ONE'S WIFE IN 1989 IS NOT CAPABLE OF BEING PREDICTED WHETHER THAT PERSON
WOULD KILL HER OR BE INVOLVED IN ANY OTHER FIGHTS OR WHATEVER.

*MS. CLARK:* OBJECTION. ARGUMENTATIVE.

*THE COURT:* SUSTAINED.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AND SO I STARTED OFF BY INDICATING TO YOU THAT I THOUGHT
THIS CASE WOULD BE A CASE WHERE WE WOULD ESTABLISH THERE WAS A RUSH TO
JUDGMENT BY THE PROSECUTION, AND THEY WOULD HAVE THEORIES AND
SPECULATION AND WE WOULD HAVE THE FACTS.

*MS. CLARK:* OBJECTION. THIS IS ARGUMENT.

*THE COURT:* I ASSUME THESE ARE THE CONCLUDING REMARKS.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* THANK YOU.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU. THEY WOULD HAVE THEORIES AND SPECULATION AND
WE WOULD HAVE THE FACTS.

*MS. CLARK:* OBJECTION.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, I'M JUST TRYING TO CONCLUDE WHAT I WAS SAYING
WHEN SHE INTERRUPTED ME. IN THIS INSTANCE, IN THIS CASE, BOTH SIDES ARE
INTERESTED IN THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH. THAT'S WHAT A TRIAL REALLY IS. IT'S
A JOURNEY FOR TRUTH, FOR YOU TO DETERMINE THE TRUE FACTS OF WHAT
HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH, 1994. WE SPENT A GREAT AMOUNT OF TIME IN
SELECTING EACH OF YOU FOR THIS TASK BECAUSE IT WILL BE A VERY
SIGNIFICANT TASK. AND IN TRUTH, I'M ALWAYS REMINDED OF SOMETHING THAT
JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL SAID, THAT:

"TRUTH FOREVER ON THE SCAFFOLD WRONG FOREVER ON THE THRONE, YET THAT
SCAFFOLD SWAYS THE FUTURE AND BEYOND THE DIM UNKNOWN STANDETH GOD WITHIN
THE SHADOWS KEEPING WATCH ABOVE HIS OWN." IN THIS CASE, GOD KNOWS WHAT
HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH.

*MR. DARDEN:* OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS ARGUMENT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* IT'S NOT ARGUMENT, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* IT'S A CLOSING COMMENT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

*MR. COCHRAN:* GOD KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 12TH, 1994. AND WE HOPE
AFTER YOU'VE HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, YOU CAN MAKE A
RATIONAL DECISION AND YOU TOO WILL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, AND YOU WILL KNOW
THAT O.J. SIMPSON --

*MS. CLARK:* OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* HE CAN SAY THAT'S WHAT HE INTENDS TO PROVE, COUNSEL. HE CAN
SAY THAT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. YOU WILL KNOW THAT THE EVIDENCE
WILL SHOW THAT O.J. SIMPSON, THAT MAN PICTURED OVER THERE, ON JUNE 12TH
DID NOT KILL HIS WIFE, DID NOT KILL RONALD GOLDMAN, AND HE IS ENTITLED
TO AN ACQUITTAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION. MAY BE THE
LONGEST OPENING STATEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS BUILDING. I APPRECIATE
YOUR PATIENCE AND THE FACT THAT YOU TOOK THE TIME TO LISTEN. THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. DEPUTY MAGNERA, WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE A BREAK. LET ME SEE COUNSEL WITHOUT THE REPORTER BEFORE WE DO
THAT THOUGH.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, WE NEED -- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
EXCUSE ME. MR. DOUGLAS, CAN YOU GRAB THAT FOR ME, PLEASE? ALL RIGHT.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE AT THAT PART OF THE TRIAL WHERE WE WILL NOW
THIS AFTERNOON START THE PRESENTATION OF THE WITNESSES AND EVIDENCE TO
YOU. AS I MENTIONED TO YOU, BEFORE WE ACTUALLY START THE PRESENTATION OF
WITNESSES, WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE MOVING AROUND OF MATERIALS AND THINGS
HERE IN THE COURTROOM. WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT. I EXPECT TO START WITH
THE WITNESSES IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR. SO I AM GOING TO EXCUSE YOU TO GO
BACK UP TO THE LOUNGE. PLEASE REMEMBER MY ADMONITION TO YOU; DON'T
DISCUSS THE CASE AMONG YOURSELVES, FORM ANY OPINIONS, DON'T TALK TO
ANYBODY ABOUT IT, DON'T LET ANYBODY TALK TO YOU. SEE YOU BACK HERE IN
ABOUT 30 MINUTES. ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO REMAIN.

(RECESS.)

*THE COURT:* WE DO NEED TO GO ON THE RECORD FIRST? MADAM REPORTER, ARE
YOU READY TO GO?

REPORTER OLSON: YES.

*THE COURT:* DEPUTY MAGNERA, YOU CAN LET THE PUBLIC BACK IN.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. LET'S HAVE IT QUIET IN THE COURTROOM, PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT. BACK ON THE RECORD IN THE SIMPSON MATTER. MISS CLARK, MR.
DARDEN. IS THERE AN OFFER REGARDING THE SUBSTANCE OF REOPENING OPENING
STATEMENT?

*MS. CLARK:* YES, YOUR HONOR, THERE IS. THANK YOU. THE PEOPLE WOULD
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE RIGHT TO ADDRESS THE JURY WITH RESPECT TO, NO.
1, MARY ANNE GERCHAS.

*THE COURT:* WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO SAY -- WHAT WOULD YOU MENTION IN
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT REGARDING MISS GERCHAS?

*MS. CLARK:* COUNSEL FAILED TO GIVE US NOTICE THAT HE INTENDED TO CALL
THIS WITNESS. DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE WILLFULLY WITHHELD THE
INFORMATION, WE WERE UNABLE TO INVESTIGATE HER, BUT AS OF THIS DATE, IN
THE LAST THREE DAYS, OUR INVESTIGATION HAS UNCOVERED THE FOLLOWING, AND
I BELIEVE MR. DARDEN HAS ALREADY INDICATED TO THE COURT WHAT THAT WAS:
THE $24,000 DEBT OWED TO THE MARRIOTT FOR STAYING AT THE HOTEL ON A BAD
CREDIT CARD, THE TWENTY SOME ODD LAWSUITS PENDING AGAINST HER.

*MS. LEWIS:* 34.

*MS. CLARK:* 34, THANK YOU. 34 LAWSUITS PENDING AGAINST HER, HER FAILURE
TO MAKE -- HER COMPLETE FAILURE TO MAKE MENTION OF THE ALLEGED
OBSERVATIONS SHE MADE TO ANYONE FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWO TO THREE
WEEKS AFTER THE MURDERS, THE FACT THAT SHE IS AN AVID O.J. FAN, HAS
COLLECTED EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH THIS CASE, ESPECIALLY ALL TABLOIDS,
AND -- MAY I HAVE ONE MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* THIS INFORMATION IS COMING AT US SO QUICKLY IT IS HARD TO
REMEMBER ALL OF IT. ESPECIALLY, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO THE COURT I HAD
ABOUT THREE HOURS SLEEP BECAUSE OF CHILD PROBLEMS. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO
SLEEP AND THEREFORE I DON'T GET TO EITHER. THE OTHER FACT IS THAT SHE
TOLD OTHERS THAT SHE WAS NOT IN FACT LOOKING FOR A CONDOMINIUM IN THAT
LOCATION THAT NIGHT, AND TOLD OTHERS OF THAT FACT, THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN
THERE. ALSO, THAT THERE ARE -- SHE HAS THREE VARIATIONS TO HER NAME AND
IT LOOKS LIKE THREE DIFFERENT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. WITH RESPECT TO
ROSA LOPEZ, I WOULD INDICATE TO THE COURT THAT ROSA LOPEZ GAVE -- THE
STATEMENT EVEN SHE GAVE TO COUNSEL DOES NOT REFLECT THAT SHE GAVE ANY OF
THE OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE BRONCO TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN, YET THAT IS
WHAT COUNSEL REPRESENTED; THEREFORE, WE DO NOT HAVE DISCOVERY OF THIS
FURTHER STATEMENT THAT COUNSEL MUST BE IN POSSESSION OF. HER STATEMENT
REFLECTS ONLY THAT SHE TOLD DETECTIVE FUHRMAN SHE HEARD SOME NOISES THAT
NIGHT. THAT IS ALL SHE SAID. COUNSEL'S STATEMENT INDICATES QUITE
DIFFERENTLY, THAT SHE HAD INDICATED TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN SHE HAD SEEN
THE BRONCO THERE AT THE ROCKINGHAM LOCATION AT 10:15. THAT IS NOT WHAT
THE STATEMENT REFLECTS. AND WE WOULD ASK LEAVE OF THE COURT TO ADDRESS
THE JURY WITH RESPECT TO ROSA LOPEZ' PRIOR STATEMENTS OF ANIMOSITY AND
BIAS AGAINST NICOLE, THAT SHE HATED NICOLE. SHE MADE STATEMENTS TO
OTHERS INDICATING THAT SHE LOVED O.J. AND WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HIM AND
WOULD TESTIFY TO ANYTHING FOR HIM. FURTHERMORE, THAT SHE MADE OTHER
STATEMENTS TO OTHER PARTIES, INDICATING THAT SHE ALSO HAD NO AWARENESS
OF ANY UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT TRANSPIRED THAT NIGHT AND THAT -- AND THAT
HER STORY WAS SO INCREDIBLE THAT WHEN SHE ATTEMPTED TO SELL IT TO THE
NATIONAL ENQUIRER THEY DECLINED TO PRINT IT. AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE TOLD
THE JURY ABOUT ALL OF THESE THINGS, ABOUT THESE WITNESSES, HAD WE BEEN --

*THE COURT:* SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A TRIAL ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF
THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER?

*MR. COCHRAN:* THAT'S FINE.

*MS. CLARK:* WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A TRIAL ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF
WITNESSES WHO ARE SO UNCREDIBLE THAT EVEN THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER WOULD
NOT USE THEIR STORY.

*THE COURT:* THAT IS HARD TO BELIEVE.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT TELLS YOU HOW -- IT CERTAINLY TELLS THE COURT HOW
UNCREDIBLE THAT WITNESS IS IF EVEN THEY DECLINED TO USE IT. AND THAT WE
WOULD HAVE INFORMED THE JURY OF THOSE WITNESSES AND OF THOSE FACTS BUT
WE WERE UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE COUNSEL WILLFULLY WITHHELD THEM.
THIRDLY, WITH RESPECT TO THE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, THE CHRONIC AND ACUTE
PHASE AS DESCRIBED BY COUNSEL, AGAIN THESE WITNESSES WERE NOT DISCLOSED
TO US AND NO STATEMENTS WERE DISCLOSED TO US INDICATIVE OF THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WOULD BE CALLED FOR THE PURPOSES OUTLINED BY
COUNSEL, AND HAD WE KNOWN, WE WOULD HAVE SHOWN THEM THE VIDEOTAPE OF THE
WORKOUT TAPE MADE BY THE DEFENDANT TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE MURDERS AND WE
WOULD LIKE TO SHOW THEM SOME OF THE OUTTAKES OF THAT VIDEOTAPE. AND
FINALLY, TO CORRECT COUNSEL'S ENTIRELY MISLEADING -- MISREPRESENTATIVE
STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE EAP MARKERS ON THE VICTIM'S BLOOD AND VICTIM'S
THIGH AND ON HER NAILS. COUNSEL MISREPRESENTED THE NATURE OF THE REPORT
TO THE JURY IN A MANNER THAT IS SO CONFUSING AND MISLEADING THAT IF WE
HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THAT TESTIMONY IS FORTHCOMING, THE JURY WILL BE
HOPELESSLY LOST. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE A DIAMETRIC OPPOSITION
BETWEEN THE REPORT AND WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SAID TO THE JURY BY MR.
COCHRAN. THE REPORT INDICATED THAT THE B TYPE THAT CAME UP ON EAP MARKER
WAS INCONSISTENT WITH ANY OF THE THREE PARTIES AND WENT ON TO STATE,
WHICH IS WHAT MR. COCHRAN NEVER LET THE JURY KNOW, THAT THAT DID NOT
RULE OUT NICOLE SIMPSON AS A POSSIBLE SOURCE BECAUSE HER TYPE BEING A
BA, THIS IS A VERY LABILE MARKER, WHICH MEANS THAT IN ESSENCE THE A
FALLS OFF WHEN THERE IS DEGRADATION, THAT THERE WAS IN FACT EVIDENCE OF
DEGRADATION OF THIS BLOOD BECAUSE HER HAND WAS FOUND CLUTCHING HER NECK
UNDER HER BODY WHERE THE BLOOD WAS WARM, VERY WET AND VERY SUBJECT TO
DEGRADATION IN A RAPID MANNER, WHICH IS WHAT CAUSED THE DEGRADATION FROM
BA TO B AND THAT IS WHAT THE REPORT REFLECTS. AND MOREOVER, COUNSEL
DIRECTLY MISREPRESENTED THE CONCLUSION OF THE EXPERT WITH RESPECT TO THE
BLOOD ON THE THIGH. THAT BLOOD INDICATED A FAINT A ACTIVITY. IT WAS A
FAINT A ACTIVITY THAT IS INDICATIVE OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS HER
BLOOD, IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH HER, AND SO THE CONCLUSION WAS
INCONCLUSIVE, NOT THAT IT WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH HER AT ALL. SO RIGHT
NOW THE JURY IS SITTING THERE HAVING BEEN TOTALLY MISLED AS TO THE
NATURE OF THE FINDINGS, NOT ONLY THAT, AND MISLED AS TO THE CONTENTS OF
THE REPORT BECAUSE COUNSEL EXCERPTED PORTIONS UNFAIRLY. I UNDERSTAND
COUNSEL DOESN'T HAVE TO READ THE WHOLE REPORT, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ
WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF THE CONCLUSIONS, NOT JUST THE ONE THAT SUITS
COUNSEL WITH RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR ITEM OF EVIDENCE, AND THAT IS
WHAT WAS UNFAIR. WE WOULD ASK LEAVE OF THE COURT TO INFORM THE JURY OF
THE FACT THAT THEY WERE MISLED, THAT THE REPORT ACTUALLY STATES AS
FOLLOWS, AND TO HIGHLIGHT ALL OF THE PORTIONS. AT THIS POINT, YOUR
HONOR, COUNSEL'S STATEMENTS TO THE JURY HAVE CAUSED, BECAUSE OF THE
NATIONAL TELEVISED NATURE OF THIS TRIAL, THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS BEEN
MISLED AS TO THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH HAS BEEN HIDDEN, HAS BEEN OBSCURED BY
COUNSEL WILLFULLY. COUNSELS KNOWS THE TRUTH, COUNSEL KNOWS WHAT WE HAVE
IN THIS BLOOD, COUNSEL KNOWS THAT THE PGM SUBTYPING HAS SHOWN THAT IT IS
HER BLOOD, AND COUNSEL KNOWS THAT TESTS ARE ONGOING, THAT IT WILL
FURTHER ESTABLISH THAT IT IS HER BLOOD UNDER HER NAILS AND ON HER THIGH,
BUT WE HAVE A WHOLE NATION HOW WHO HAS BEEN MISLED AS TO THE NATURE OF
THIS EVIDENCE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THAT THIS JURY HAS BEEN WILLFULLY
MISLED AND BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE THAT THE CONCLUSIONS ARE DIAMETRICALLY
THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY REALLY WERE. SO WE WOULD ASK LEAVE OF THE
COURT TO ADDRESS THE JURY WITH RESPECT TO THAT ITEM AS WELL.

*THE COURT:* LET ME ASK YOU THIS, MISS CLARK. LET'S TAKE IT FROM THE
TOP. AS TO MISS GERCHAS, THERE IS THE CLAIM OF RIGHT TO REOPEN SINCE
THERE WAS NO NOTICE GIVEN OF THIS PERSON'S STATEMENT. THIS IS THE PERSON
WHO IS ALLEGED TO HAVE SEEN FOUR INDIVIDUALS IN THE VICINITY LEAVING THE
SCENE ROUGHLY AT A TIME CONSISTENT WITH THIS PARTICULAR CRIME, SO
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WITNESS IF THIS TESTIMONY PANS OUT. WHAT
IN YOUR OFFER OF PROOF DO YOU BELIEVE SHOWS LACK OF CREDIBILITY AND
WOULD BE ADMISSIBLE AS IMPEACHMENT EVIDENCE? I MEAN, YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY HAS 34 PENDING LAWSUITS AGAINST THEM DOESN'T
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY ARE NOT A CREDIBLE PERSON. I MEAN, THEY COULD
BE ALL CAR CRASHES FOR ALL WE KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

*MS. CLARK:* RIGHT.

*THE COURT:* I MEAN, OTHER STATEMENTS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT, THAT SORT
OF THING. I MEAN, THAT IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE. IT HAS TO GO DIRECTLY TO
CREDIBILITY, OTHER BAD ACTS.

*MS. CLARK:* YES. I APPRECIATE THAT, YOUR HONOR. WITH RESPECT TO THOSE
LAWSUITS, WE WILL BE CALLING WITNESSES TO TESTIFY TO THE FACT THAT THEY
WERE FOR FRAUD, WHICH DOES GO DIRECTLY TO CREDIBILITY.

*THE COURT:* HOW MANY OF THESE LAWSUITS ARE ACTUALLY FINAL WITH
JUDGMENTS RENDERED AGAINST MISS GERCHAS FOR FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT
ACTIVITY, BECAUSE I'M NOT WILLING TO LITIGATE TWENTY OTHER LAWSUITS IF
THERE ISN'T SOME VERDICT IN THEM.

*MS. CLARK:* WE COULD SIMPLY CALL THE PARTIES TO THE LAWSUIT TO INDICATE
WHY THEY HAVE SUED HER. THEY WOULD INDICATE THAT I BELIEVE WITH RESPECT
TO ALMOST ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, ALL 34, THEY ALL
DEAL WITH FRAUD AND MISREPRESENTATIONS IN THE OPERATION OF HER BUSINESS,
AND --

*THE COURT:* WELL, DO WE KNOW HOW MANY OF THESE HAVE RESULTED IN VERDICTS?

*MS. CLARK:* I'M SORRY? I CAN'T HEAR YOU COUNSEL IS TALKING SO LOUD.

*THE COURT:* DO WE KNOW HOW MANY OF THESE CASES HAVE RESULTED IN VERDICTS?

*MS. CLARK:* I --

*THE COURT:* HAVE REACHED VERDICTS?

*MS. CLARK:* MAY I INQUIRE, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. BAILEY:* DOES YOUR HONOR MEAN JUDGMENTS?

*THE COURT:* JUDGMENTS, VERDICTS, SAME THING.

*MR. BAILEY:* DIFFERENT.

*THE COURT:* NOT FOR THIS PURPOSE.

*MS. CLARK:* BECAUSE COUNSEL HAS HAMSTRUNG US BY HIDING THIS WITNESS, WE
HAVE NOT HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TO COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION, AND WE
HAVE OBTAINED A LIST OF ALL OF THE -- THAT IS WHAT MR. DARDEN IS HOLDING
RIGHT NOW -- A LIST OF ALL THE FILES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST HER,
BUT WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE EACH AND EVERY ONE TO DETERMINE THE
RESOLUTION OF EACH ONE. IF COUNSEL HAD GIVEN US THIS INFORMATION IN A
TIMELY FASHION, YOUR HONOR, I COULD HAVE STOOD HERE BEFORE THE COURT AND
EXPLAINED AND GIVEN THE ANSWERS TO ALL OF THIS A LONG TIME AGO, BUT IT
HAS BEEN SEVEN MONTHS SINCE THEY TOOK THE STATEMENT AND WE JUST GOT THE
NOTION OF HER EXISTENCE LAST WEEK.

*THE COURT:* WELL, MISS CLARK, THEN SINCE THESE REVELATIONS ON
WEDNESDAY, YOU HAVEN'T SENT A LAW CLERK OVER TO THE CIVIL INDEX TO GO
CHECK THE STATUS OF ALL THESE CASES?

*MS. CLARK:* WE ARE CHECKING MANY DIFFERENT -- WE ARE MAKING CHECKS ON
ALL OF THE REPRESENTATIONS OF COUNSEL. THERE IS A LOT TO CHECK, YOUR
HONOR, AND WITH ROSA LOPEZ AS WELL.

*THE COURT:* WOULDN'T YOU SAY THIS IS A RATHER KEY -- KEY PLACE WHERE
YOU SHOULD FOCUS YOUR EFFORT?

*MS. CLARK:* IT IS ONE OF THEM, YES, AND WE HAVE BEEN. WE HAVE
INVESTIGATORS OUT RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE HAD. THAT IS ONE OF THE MANY
AREAS REGARDING MISS GERCHAS THAT WE ARE INVESTIGATING, BUT THERE IS A
LOT TO INVESTIGATE IN MISS GERCHAS, JUST -- A LOT, NOT TO MENTION THE
THREE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, THE THREE PHONY NAMES. THERE IS A LOT TO
TALK ABOUT WITH THIS GIRL.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* RIGHT IN FRONT OF US WE HAVE FOUR JUDGMENTS SHOWN AND WE
HAVE ADDITIONAL PAPERWORK THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH UPSTAIRS AS WE SPEAK.

*THE COURT:* SO WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR ME TO DO? TO DELAY THESE
PROCEEDINGS UNTIL YOU COMPLETE YOUR INVESTIGATION?

*MS. CLARK:* I DON'T THINK IT IS ASKING FOR VERY MUCH TO ASK FOR SOME
ADDITIONAL TIME TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT TO THE JURY AN OPENING STATEMENT
THAT COMPRISES ALL OF THE FACTS, SINCE IT IS NOT OUR FAULT THAT WE
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO INVESTIGATE THIS PERSON.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ROSA LOPEZ. MY RECOLLECTION
IS THAT HER NAME DOES APPEAR ON THE DEFENSE WITNESS LIST AND THAT YOU
DID HAVE INFORMATION REGARDING HER PREVIOUSLY; IS THAT CORRECT?

*MS. CLARK:* YES. WE HAD LIMITED INFORMATION REGARDING HER. WE HAVE NEW
REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY COUNSEL THAT INDICATE THAT THERE ARE OTHER
STATEMENTS THAT WE ARE NOT IN POSSESSION OF. THE ACTUAL STATEMENT GIVEN
TO US BY COUNSEL INDICATES THAT WHAT SHE TOLD DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WAS THAT
SHE HEARD SOME NOISES LAST NIGHT. THAT IS ALL IT SAYS. COUNSEL MADE
REPRESENTATIONS THAT SHE TOLD DETECTIVE FUHRMAN THAT SHE WAS OUT AT
10:15 AND SAW THE BRONCO ON ROCKINGHAM, THAT SHE WAS OUT EARLIER AT 8:30
AND SAW THE BRONCO ON ROCKINGHAM, THAT --

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* -- THAT DETECTIVE FUHRMAN WAS IN POSSESSION OF ALL OF THESE
FACTS AND ALL OF THOSE DETAILS WHEN IN FACT THEIR OWN WITNESS STATEMENT
INDICATES ONLY THAT SHE TOLD DETECTIVE FUHRMAN SHE HEARD SOME NOISES
LAST NIGHT, PERIOD. NO MENTION OF A BRONCO, NO MENTION OF BEING OUT
WALKING HER DOG, NO MENTION OF SEEING THE BRONCO ANYWHERE.

*THE COURT:* WHEN DID YOU RECEIVE THIS --

*MS. CLARK:* THAT STATEMENT?

*THE COURT:* -- THIS STATEMENT?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* SEPTEMBER 1, SO WHAT COUNSEL REPRESENTED AS HAVING BEEN
STATED BY THIS WITNESS TO THE JURY IS NOT AT ALL WHAT WAS CONTAINED IN
THE JURY STATEMENT THAT HE GAVE TO US.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. HERE IS ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES, MISS CLARK. YOU
ARE ARGUING ROSA LOPEZ. THIS IS THE FIRST ARGUMENT REGARDING ROSA LOPEZ
FROM THE PROSECUTION POINT OF VIEW. SHE WAS NOT PART OF OUR DISCOVERY
SANCTIONS MOTION, TO MY RECOLLECTION.

*MS. CLARK:* SHE WASN'T.

*THE COURT:* SHE WAS NOT.

*MS. CLARK:* NO, I KNOW. I KNOW, YOUR HONOR. WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE
TRANSCRIPT -- YOU HAVE TO -- YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TELL US TO GO AND DO
SOMETHING, IT DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN LIKE THAT. WE HAVE TO GO UP AND WE
HAVE TO WORK, WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE TRANSCRIPT. WE WERE UP ALL NIGHT
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE TRANSCRIPT WE FOUND
THAT THERE WERE MANY DIFFERENT STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO HER THAT WE DID
NOT HAVE.

*THE COURT:* WELL, COUNSEL, HERE IS THE PROBLEM, WE TOOK OUR RECESS TO
DO THAT. I ASKED YOU TO GO THROUGH THE RECORD AND FIND ALL OF THESE
SANCTIONS -- ALL OF THESE DISCOVERY TRANSGRESSIONS THAT YOU COULD FIND.
THE PROBLEM THAT THE COURT HAS IS I'M JUST THE REFEREE HERE. I'M NOT
PRIVY TO WHAT INFORMATION EITHER SIDE HAS. YOU KNOW THE DETAILS OF YOUR
CASE, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN DISCOVERY. I HAVE NO IDEA. I WENT
THROUGH THE RECORD. I FOUND THE NAMES OF THE FOURTEEN WITNESSES WHOSE
STATEMENTS WERE GIVEN OVER LAST WEDNESDAY. I WENT THROUGH THE RECORD AND
FOUND THE EXPERT WITNESSES WHO HAD BEEN DISCUSSED THAT HAD NOT
PREVIOUSLY BEEN DISCLOSED OR IT WAS UNCLEAR FROM THE RECORD WHO THEY
WERE AND THOSE THAT YOU OBJECTED TO. NOW YOU ARE RAISING AN ADDITIONAL
OBJECTION TO ROSA LOPEZ THAT HAS NOT BEEN LITIGATED AND YOU ARE RAISING
A DIFFERENT OBJECTION TO THE -- MR. COCHRAN'S STATEMENTS REGARDING THE
BLOOD -- THE EAP BLOOD TIMING, CORRECT?

*MS. CLARK:* YES.

*THE COURT:* NEITHER OF WHICH WAS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY IN OUR SANCTIONS
MOTION, CORRECT?

*MS. CLARK:* I DID OBJECT ON THE BLOOD BEFORE. I DID. WE WENT TO SIDE
BAR AND I MADE AN OBJECTION FOR THE RECORD TO THE COURT CONCERNING THE
MISLEADING NATURE OF COUNSEL'S REMARK. I AM ON THE RECORD WITH RESPECT
TO THAT, YOUR HONOR, AT SIDE BAR, AND --

*THE COURT:* PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT WAS PART OF OUR SHOW AND TELL
WHERE THAT WAS EXHIBITED TO YOU AND YOU HAD NO OBJECTION TO THAT
EXHIBIT. THAT IS WHY I OVERRULED YOUR OBJECTION. THERE WERE TWO DAYS
WHERE COUNSEL EXCHANGED EXHIBITS, SHOWED THEM TO EACH OTHER, AND IT WAS
A LITTLE LATE IN THE MIDDLE OF COUNSEL'S OPENING STATEMENT TO THEN START
LODGING OBJECTIONS TO AN EXHIBIT THAT BOTH SIDES HAD SEEN AND HAD WAIVED
ANY OBJECTION TO.

*MS. CLARK:* I DIDN'T --

*THE COURT:* THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

*MS. CLARK:* BUT I DID NOT REALIZE THAT COUNSEL WAS GOING TO EXCERPT A
HALF OF A SENTENCE, WHICH IS WHAT HE DID. I WOULD LIKE TO -- IF I MAY,
YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW THE COURT. IF THE COURT DOESN'T REALIZE
THERE IS A PARAGRAPH, COUNSEL TOOK OUT TWO LINES FROM THAT PARAGRAPH AND
IT ACTUALLY IS -- I THINK THE COURT SHOULD SEE IT, I REALLY DO. I THINK
IF THE COURT SEES IT, IT WOULD REALIZE I WAS MISLED. I THOUGHT THIS
ENTIRE PARAGRAPH WAS GOING TO BE SHOWN. IF IT HAD BEEN, I WOULDN'T HAVE
OBJECTED, BUT IT WASN'T. AS A MATTER OF FACT, ANOTHER THING THAT
HAPPENED, YOUR HONOR, WAS THAT I WAS SHOWN THE FRONT PAGE OF THE
CORONER'S TRANSCRIPT AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT ONE AREA WAS GOING TO BE
HIGHLIGHTED FOR THE JURY ON THAT FRONT PAGE, AND LO AND BEHOLD IN FRONT
OF THE JURY I SEE COUNSEL GOING AFTER PAGE AFTER PAGE AFTER PAGE WHICH I
WAS NOT TOLD ABOUT. I DIDN'T BOTHER TO OBJECT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO
INTERRUPT OPENING STATEMENT ANY MORE THAN I NEEDED TO, BUT AS A MATTER
OF FACT, I WAS MISLED, BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THIS AND WITH RESPECT TO THE
CORONER'S REPORT. COUNSEL PUT IN A LOT MORE OR IN THIS CASE A LOT LESS
THAN WHAT I WAS LEAD TO BELIEVE HE WAS GOING TO DO.

*THE COURT:* WELL, MISS CLARK, LET ME ASK YOU THIS, THOUGH, AFTER WE
SPENT TWO COURT DAYS DOING A SHOW AND TELL AND YOU WAIVED YOUR
OBJECTIONS, I MEAN, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GO BACK AND NOW REVISIT THIS
AND ALLOW YOU TO REOPEN OPENING STATEMENTS? BECAUSE SO FAR THE ONLY
THING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT REMOTELY APPROACH BEING ABLE TO
REOPEN ON YOUR COMMENTS AS TO MISS GERCHAS AS TO JUDGMENTS AGAINST HER
AND THE EXERCISE VIDEO CONTRAVENING THE ARTHRITIS EXPERTS, THAT HAD BEEN
NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, BUT ROSA LOPEZ IS AN OBJECTION JUST NOW
BEING RAISED AND THE EAP IS SOMETHING, ALTHOUGH YOU DID RAISE THAT
OBJECTION EARLIER, I THINK -- I THINK YOU HAVE WAIVED THAT OBJECTION,
HAVING PASSED ON THE EXHIBIT.

*MS. CLARK:* I DIDN'T PASS ON THE EXHIBIT, YOUR HONOR. THAT IS THE
PROBLEM. THAT IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE COURT. NO. 1 THING,
LET ME GET BACK TO ROSA LOPEZ. AS TO ROSA LOPEZ, SHE WAS MENTIONED BY
COUNSEL TODAY.

*THE COURT:* NO, NO. IF YOU ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE EAP, LET'S QUIT
JUMPING AROUND. TELL ME ABOUT THE EAP AND WHY YOU FEEL YOU WERE MISLED.

*MS. CLARK:* I THINK WHAT THE COURT DOESN'T REMEMBER IS WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE SHOW AND TELL ON FRIDAY AND COUNSEL ONLY SHOWED ME A TENTH OF
WHAT THEY HAD. WE CAME BACK IN ON MONDAY AND AT THE 11TH HOUR, BEFORE WE
WERE TO BEGIN OUR OPENING STATEMENT, COUNSEL SPRUNG TWENTY NEW BOARDS ON
US AND THEN PULLED OUT THE REPORTS. THOSE REPORTS WERE NOT SHOWN TO ME
ON FRIDAY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT I WAS SHOWN THE REPORTS, THE CORONER
AND THIS ONE, IT WAS -- I WAS MISLED AS TO WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO USE,
AND ONLY WHEN IT WAS SHOWN BEFORE THE JURY DID I REALIZE WHAT HE
INTENDED TO DO. I MADE THE OBJECTION AS TIMELY AS I POSSIBLY COULD; THE
MOMENT HE DID IT. I WAS OVERRULED. NEVERTHELESS, I WAS MISLED, AND IF I
SHOW THE COURT HOW THIS PARAGRAPH APPEARS, I THINK THAT THE COURT WILL
UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS MISLED. YOU KNOW, COUNSEL POINTED TO THIS PORTION
OF THIS -- OF ONE PARTICULAR RESULT ON THIS PAGE, AND I BELIEVED THAT IT
WAS GOING TO BE FAIRLY EXHIBITED TO THE JURY IN CONTEXT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU READ IT FOR THE RECORD.

*MS. CLARK:* YOU KNOW WHAT, IF I COULD USE THE ELMO, I CAN SHOW IT AND
READ IT AT THE SAME TIME.

*THE COURT:* BY GOLLY, LET'S DO THAT.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MS. CLARK:* THE PART THAT I HAVE DRAWN, YOUR HONOR, THE BRACKET AROUND,
THAT IS THE ITEM IN ISSUE.

"ITEM 84-A" IS THAT "84-B AND 118-A COULD NOT HAVE COME FROM NICOLE
BROWN SIMPSON, RONALD GOLDMAN OR O.J. SIMPSON; HOWEVER, NICOLE BROWN
SIMPSON CANNOT BE EXCLUDED AS A SOURCE OF THE STAIN IN THE EAP. TYPE B
OBSERVED ON THE ITEMS WERE DEGRADED FROM A TYPE B A." NOW, THERE WILL BE
SUBSTANTIAL LITERATURE, YOUR HONOR, TO THE EFFECT THAT A TYPE BA
FREQUENTLY DOES BREAK DOWN TO A TYPE B, AND THERE IS EVIDENCE OF
DEGRADATION HERE THAT INDICATES THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED, BUT
WHAT COUNSEL DID WAS HE TOOK THAT FIRST LINE AND DROPPED OFF THE REST
AND THE REST OF IT IS VITAL TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE EXPERT.

*THE COURT:* AND WHAT WAS SHOWN TO YOU AS AN EXHIBIT?

*MS. CLARK:* THIS PAGE AND THAT PARAGRAPH WAS POINTED TO ME; NOT THAT
ONE LINE, THAT ENTIRE PARAGRAPH.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* THAT IS NOT TRUE. WE SHOWED THE LASER DISK.

*THE COURT:* MR. HARRIS, IS HE AVAILABLE?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* HE TOOK IT WITH HIM.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE WILL BE GLAD TO GET IT FROM HIM. SHALL I GET HIM BACK
DOWN HERE?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* YOUR HONOR, WE WENT THROUGH ALL THE LASER DISKS AND WE
ONLY HAD THE HIGHLIGHTED PORTION THAT WE SHOWED ON TWO BOARDS, ONE WITH
THE COVER HIGHLIGHTED AND THEN PULLING OUT THE HIGHLIGHT. WE ONLY SHOWED
THE LASER BOARD. ALL OF OUR PRESENTATION WAS SHOWN.

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR, I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER SEEING A LASER ON THIS.
ALL I REMEMBER HAVING COUNSEL TELL ME WAS SHOWING ME A REPORT -- YOU
KNOW, I WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN COUNSEL TO SIDE BAR AND OBJECTED TO
SOMETHING HAD I KNOWN WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I
WOULD HAVE OBJECTED STRENUOUSLY AHEAD OF TIME HAD I REALIZE THAT HE WAS
GOING TO TAKE ONE LINE OUT OF CONTEXT OUTSIDE OF A PARAGRAPH.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY I HAVE HERE. I
MEAN, YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE IT AND NOW YOU WANT
TO COME BACK AND DO IT AGAIN. THAT IS MY PROBLEM. WHERE IS MR. HARRIS?

*MR. DOUGLAS:* ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE OFFICE, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. BAILEY:* WE WEREN'T TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE LASER DISK WOULD BE
USED IN REOPENING, SHOULD YOU PERMIT IT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MISS CLARK, THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT I
CAN'T DEAL WITH THEN IF THE LASER DISK ITSELF, THE EXHIBIT THAT THEY
SHOWED YOU, IS IN FACT GONE, BECAUSE I NEED TO MAKE A FACTUAL FINDING AS
TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS SOME -- THAT YOU WERE MISLED IN SOME WAY AS
TO WHAT IT WAS.

*MS. CLARK:* I WILL TELL YOU, YOUR HONOR, I DID NOT -- I DON'T RECALL
SEEING A LASER DISK.

*THE COURT:* WELL, LET'S -- MISS CLARK, LET'S LOOK AT THE LASER DISK AND
SEE WHAT IS THERE, BECAUSE THAT IS PRETTY MUCH FROZEN IN ITS STATE. YOU
KNOW, THAT IS NOT EASY TO MANIPULATE, SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
UNFORTUNATELY, WE PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT FOR QUITE SOME TIME
SINCE MR. HARRIS IS ON HIS WAY. WE WILL HAVE TO CATCH HIM AND CALL HIM
BACK.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WE MAY BE ABLE TO CATCH HIM.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* YOUR HONOR, I CAN REPRESENT TO THE COURT THAT WE DID NOT
HAVE THE DOCUMENT HERE ON MONDAY, WE HAD ONLY THE LASER DISK, AND THE
COURT REQUIRED THAT WE GO THROUGH AND SHOW EVERYTHING.

*THE COURT:* WHICH IS WHY, MR. DOUGLAS, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE LASER DISK.

*MS. CLARK:* BUT WHY WASN'T IT BEING SHOWN TO US ON MONDAY? WHY WAS IT
ONLY BEING SHOWN ON FRIDAY? THIS IS VERY UNFAIR. THE DEFENDANT WAS
REQUIRED TO SHOW ALL THEIR EXHIBITS ON FRIDAY. AS WE DID FOR THEM. WE
SPRUNG NOTHING ON THEM. THEY CAME MARCHING IN ON MONDAY WITH TWICE AS
MANY EXHIBITS AS WE WERE SHOWN ON FRIDAY. WE WERE EXPECTED TO ABSORB
EVERYTHING IN A NANOSECOND AND COME UP WITH COGENT OBJECTIONS TO EACH
AND EVERY ITEM. THAT IS VERY UNFAIR. THE PEOPLE WERE PUT AT A GREAT
DISADVANTAGE AND HAVING TO ABSORB A GREAT DEAL IN A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME
AND COME UP WITH OBJECTIONS. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE ALL THAT
SURPRISING THAT I COULDN'T REMEMBER SEEING ONE OF ABOUT FIFTY NEW
EXHIBITS THAT WAS THROWN AT ME MONDAY MORNING BEFORE OUR OPENING
STATEMENTS WERE TO BEGIN, AND THAT ALONE SHOULD CAUSE THE COURT TO
REALIZE THAT THE PEOPLE WERE PUT AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH RESPECT TO BEING
ABLE TO MAKE INTELLIGENT OBJECTIONS TO ALL OF THE WEALTH OF NEW
INFORMATION THAT WAS UNJUSTIFIABLY THROWN AT US AT THE 11TH HOUR. WE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN MORE TIME AT THIS POINT.

*THE COURT:* DID YOU ASK FOR ANY ADDITIONAL TIME AT THAT POINT?

*MS. CLARK:* I DID AND THE COURT WAS -- I INDICATED TO THE COURT AT THE
TIME, YOUR HONOR, THAT I DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE IT
CAREFULLY, AND YOU ASKED ME TO IMMEDIATELY GO THROUGH BOARD BY BOARD AND
EXHIBIT BY EXHIBIT WITH ABOUT TEN SECONDS FOR EACH. THERE REALLY WAS NOT
A LOT OF TIME. THE COURT IS CONCERNED, I UNDERSTAND, ABOUT HAVING THE
TIME OF THE JURY SPENT FRUITFULLY AND I'M MINDFUL OF THAT, AND I
APPRECIATE THAT, AND THE COURT, YOU KNOW, WAS FEELING THE TIME
CONSTRAINT, UNDERSTANDABLY SO, AND SO WAS I, BUT THE RESULT OF WHAT HAS
BEEN MISCONDUCT BY COUNSEL IN FAILING TO TURN OVER EXHIBITS IN A TIMELY
FASHION SHOULD NOT INURE TO THE PEOPLE'S DETRIMENT AS IT HAS BEEN AND I
THINK THAT IS VERY UNFAIR.

*THE COURT:* SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT LAST MONDAY, THE 9TH -- EXCUSE ME,
I'M SORRY, THE 23RD, JUST SO I CAN CHECK THE RECORD, IF I HAVE TO. ALL
RIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE UP THAT ISSUE UNLESS AND UNTIL I SEE THE
ACTUAL LASER DISK EXHIBIT, WHICH HAS UNFORTUNATELY LEFT THE COURTROOM.
THAT LEAVES ME WITH GERCHAS AND THE ARTHRITIS EXPERTS.

*MS. CLARK:* OKAY. WITH RESPECT TO THOSE WITNESSES WHICH WE -- THE COURT
KNOWS WE WERE NOT INFORMED OF, EITHER THEIR NAMES OR THEIR STATEMENTS OR
THEIR PROPOSED TESTIMONY, WE WOULD ASK LEAVE OF THE COURT TO ADDRESS THE
JURY WITH RESPECT TO THE FACT THAT WE WERE NOT APPRISED OF THEIR
INTENTION TO CALL SUCH WITNESSES, TO DESCRIBE THE DEFENDANT'S PHYSICAL
CONDITION AT THE TIME OF THE MURDERS, AND THAT HAD WE KNOWN WE WOULD
HAVE DISCUSSED THAT WITH THE JURY AT GREATER LENGTH, PUTTING ON THE
EXERCISE TAPE. NOW, COUNSEL SHOWED US PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE DEFENDANT'S
BODY THAT THEY INTENDED TO INTRODUCE, BUT THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS GAVE US
ABSOLUTELY IN NOTICE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE PRESENTING TESTIMONY
CONCERNING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER COMMENT, MISS CLARK?

*MS. CLARK:* MAY I HAVE A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* FURTHERMORE, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXISTENCE OF HOWARD
WEITZMAN, THAT WAS ANOTHER MATTER THAT WAS NOT TURNED OVER TO US IN
DISCOVERY. THE NAME WAS NOT EVEN ON OUR WITNESS LIST. HAD WE KNOWN THAT
THEY WOULD MAKE THESE REPRESENTATIONS TO THE JURY THAT MR. WEITZMAN WAS
EXCLUDED FROM THE CONFERENCE ROOM, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS
THE JURY ON THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY DID THAT NOT HAPPEN, BUT THE OFFICERS
ARE VERY WELL AWARE THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF LAW. AS A MATTER OF
FACT, IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS CONTAINED IN THE MIRANDA ADVISEMENT, THAT
MR. WEITZMAN WAS IN FACT POINTEDLY INVITED IN WITH MR. SIMPSON, THAT HE
DECLINED TO REMAIN WITH MR. SIMPSON, AND HIMSELF DECIDED TO LEAVE THE
FACILITY, AND WE WOULD HAVE TOLD THE JURY ALL ABOUT THAT. WE WOULD HAVE
EVEN MAYBE READ THE MIRANDA ADVISEMENT TO THE JURY SO THAT THEY CAN
UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN OBLIGATION OF THE POLICE TO AFFORD ANYONE WHO
APPEARS WITH HIS ATTORNEY THE RIGHT TO HAVE THE ATTORNEY PRESENT DURING
QUESTIONING AND THAT MR. SIMPSON WAS SO ADVISED AND THAT HE ELECTED TO
PROCEED WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF HIS ATTORNEY AND THAT THAT -- I MEAN, WE
COULD HAVE DONE ALL OF THAT, BUT COUNSEL -- AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE
THAT WAIVER ON TAPE. COUNSEL IS AWARE OF THAT, BUT YET COUNSEL
DELIBERATELY CHOSE TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT WAS FALSE TO THIS JURY
CONCERNING MR. WEITZMAN. HAD WE KNOWN HE INTENDED TO DO SO AND HAD WE
KNOWN MR. WEITZMAN INTENDED TO SO TESTIFY, WE WOULD HAVE PUT THAT BEFORE
THE JURY. FURTHERMORE, ALL OF THE EVIDENCE WITH RESPECT TO THE CIRCLE OF
BENEVOLENCE, THE CHARITY AND THE GIFT GIVING, WE HAVE NO DISCOVERY OF
ANY OF THAT, YOUR HONOR, THAT DEFENSE COUNSEL WANTED TO PRESENT THAT,
AND WITH RESPECT TO AT LEAST THE REPRESENTATION OF ANONYMOUS GIFT GIVING
TO LINKS, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL HAVE EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT
WAS -- THAT TO THE EXTENT MONEY WAS GIVEN, IT WAS NOT ANONYMOUSLY GIVEN,
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO THE PRESENT TO THE JURY THAT THE FACT THAT THE
AMOUNT GIVEN TO CHARITY WAS MINUSCULE COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF NET
WORTH THIS DEFENDANT HAD. AND SO WE WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
COUNTER SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE WHICH WAS ALSO -- STILL HAS NOT BEEN
TURNED OVER IN DISCOVERY, STILL ONLY KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE OF THAT IS THE
REPRESENTATIONS OF COUNSEL IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT TO THE JURY.

*THE COURT:* UH-HUH.

*MS. CLARK:* FURTHERMORE, WITH RESPECT TO SKIP TAFT, I ALSO BELIEVE
COUNSEL AGAIN -- THIS IS ANOTHER NAME THAT WAS NOT PUT ON THE DEFENSE
WITNESS LIST FOR WHOM WE HAVE NO STATEMENT, BUT COUNSEL REPRESENTED THAT
MR. TAFT WOULD TESTIFY CONCERNING THE CONTENTS OF A PRENUPTIAL
AGREEMENT. MAY I HAVE A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*THE COURT:* IS THERE ANY DISPUTE ABOUT THAT?

*MS. CLARK:* I BELIEVE THERE IS -- MAY I HAVE A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. COCHRAN:* MR. BAILEY WILL RESPOND FOR US, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. CLARK:* THERE WERE CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS MADE WITH RESPECT TO
WHAT SKIP TAFT WOULD TESTIFY TO IN THAT PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT, THAT HE
WOULD TESTIFY TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING IT, THAT -- AND IT WAS
REPRESENTED TO THIS JURY AS BEING ANOTHER ACT IN THE CIRCLE OF
BENEVOLENCE, THAT IN FACT IT WAS A CIVIL COMPROMISE ATTEMPT AND NOTHING
MORE BY THE DEFENDANT IN AN EFFORT TO PRESSURE NICOLE TO WITHDRAW HER
SUPPORT FOR THE PROSECUTION OF THAT CASE. AND WE WOULD LIKE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE JURY AS TO THE TRUTH OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
UNDER WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE, YOUR HONOR. I JUST CAN'T -- IT
DOESN'T COME TO MIND AT THIS MOMENT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. CLARK:* BUT THAT IS FOR STARTERS.

*THE COURT:* MR. BAILEY.

*MR. BAILEY:* IF IT PLEASE THE COURT, IN ASKING THIS COURT TO SET WHAT I
THINK WOULD BE A PRECEDENT IN CRIMINAL CASES, THE PROSECUTION NOW WISHES
TO ESCALATE THAT REMEDY TO A FULL BLOWN REBUTTAL OF THINGS THEY WISH
THEY THOUGHT OF WHEN THEY GAVE THEIR OPENING STATEMENT. THEY KNEW BEFORE
THEY OPENED THAT MR. SIMPSON INTENDED TO EXHIBIT HIS SCARRED AND TORN UP
KNEE TO THE JURY AND CLAIM THAT HE WAS DISABLE TO A DEGREE. THEY HAD THE
EXERCISE TAPE; THEY ELECTED NOT TO PLAY IT. NOW IN RETROSPECT IT SEEMS A
BAD IDEA THAT THEY DIDN'T. SINCE YOU HAVE STRICKEN FROM OUR OPENING THE
NAMES AND ANY SUMMARY OF WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY OF THE WITNESS' ENUMERATED
IN YOUR ORDER, IT SEEMS TO BE MOST ANOMALOUS TO SILENCE US AND LET THE
PROSECUTION GET UP AND TRASH THEM WITHOUT REBUTTAL, MAKING WILD
STATEMENTS LIKE ROSA LOPEZ IS AN O.J. SIMPSON FAN WHEN SHE HAS NEVER MET
HIM OR NICOLE. FURTHERMORE, ALL THIS CLAIM OF SURPRISE ON ROSA LOPEZ IS
TOTALLY INCREDIBLE. YOU WILL RECALL THAT AS PART OF OUR OFFER OF PROOF,
IN RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMAND TO YOU, WE CITED TWO PRELIMINARY
INCIDENTS, BOTH OCCURRING ON THE 13TH, WHICH SHOWED BAD FAITH ON THE
PART OF MARK FUHRMAN. ONE WAS THE GLOVE AND THE OTHER WAS SUPPRESSING A
STATEMENT THAT ROSA LOPEZ HAD GIVEN HIM. IT WAS IN THE PAPERS, IT WAS
FAXED TO THE GOVERNMENT ON SUNDAY, THE 8TH. IT WAS ARGUED ORALLY HERE
AND IT WAS IN PART I GUESS THE BASIS FOR YOUR RULING, TOGETHER WITH THE
ANTHONY CASE. MR. COCHRAN, LONG AFTER THE STATEMENT WAS TAKEN AND BEFORE
THIS REPRESENTATION WAS MADE TO THE COURT, PERSONALLY WANTED TO VERIFY
THAT SHE CLAIMED THAT SHE HAD MADE THOSE STATEMENTS TO FUHRMAN AND ON
THAT BASIS WE ASSERTED IT TO YOUR HONOR. I NEVER HEARD IT DENIED IN THE
COURSE OF THE WHOLE ARGUMENT. I DON'T THINK ROSA LOPEZ IS ANY PART OF
ANY REOPENING. PERHAPS -- PERHAPS AS TO GERCHAS, IF SOME ADMISSIBLE
INFORMATION CAN BE GOTTEN, THE COURT CAN NOW PERMIT THIS NOW THOROUGHLY
TRASHED WOMAN WHO HAS NEVER HAD A DAY TO APPEAR, ALTHOUGH SHE HAS
EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN DOING THAT, TO BE IMPEACHED IF IN GOOD FAITH
THEY CLAIM AND AS OFFICERS OF THE COURT THEY ASSURE YOU THAT THEY WILL
PRODUCE ON THE WITNESS STAND UNDER OATH PEOPLE WHO WILL TESTIFY THAT SHE
HAS MADE THE STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO HER -- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
JUDGMENTS NOW OR CHECK CASES -- I'M TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHING STATEMENTS
-- IF THOSE REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE MADE IN GOOD FAITH, PERHAPS YOUR
HONOR MIGHT PERMIT THEM TO TALK ABOUT IT. I HAVEN'T HEARD ANOTHER THING
IN ALL MRS. CLARK'S PRESENTATION THAT MAKES ANY SENSE AT ALL AS
REOPENING AS A REMEDY FOR THE SANCTIONS AS PART OF THE SANCTIONS YOU
HAVE IMPOSED. INSOFAR AS THE BLOOD EVIDENCE IS CONCERNED, WE HAVE AN
ASSERTION OF FACT COULD NOT HAVE COME FROM NICOLE SIMPSON, AND IN AN
ATTEMPT TO BAIL OUT BY SOMEBODY WHO OBVIOUSLY IS IN THE PROSECUTION'S
CORNER SPECULATING THAT IF THE BLOOD WERE DEGRADED AB MIGHT HAVE SHOWN
UP AS B AND THEREFORE THAT WOULD EXPLAIN IT WITHOUT BRINGING IN ANOTHER
PARTY, IT WOULD SHOW THAT ON THE SCREEN, IT IS IN THE STATEMENT. IF WE
HAD IT TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN, I DON'T THINK ANY COURT COULD COMPEL US TO
LINK THE AUTHOR'S SPECULATION WITH HIS ESTABLISHED FACT AND THAT IS ALL
THAT SECOND SENTENCE IS. WE PAY IT NO IMPORTANCE AT ALL AND WE DON'T
THINK THAT IT IS GOING TO PAN OUT, BUT IN ANY EVENT, IN OPENING
STATEMENT, WE ARE ENTITLED TO SHOW THE JURY THOSE AREA THAT FAVOR US.
NOW, APART FROM MISS GERCHAS, I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR HONOR SHOULD PERMIT
ANY OF WHAT HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE PROSECUTION. IT IS NOTHING MORE
THAN A CHANCE TO COME BACK AND REBUT THE DEFENSE OPENING STATEMENT. THEY
COULD HAVE HANDLED ALL OF THESE MATTERS BEFOREHAND IF THEY HAD THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING AS CAREFULLY AS MR. COCHRAN DID WHEN HE LAID
OUT HIS VERY DETAILED PRESENTATION.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK.

*MS. CLARK:* WITH RESPECT TO THE BLOOD ARGUMENT JUST GIVEN BY MR.
BAILEY, HE DEMONSTRATES NOTHING BUT HIS IGNORANCE. AS A MATTER OF FACT,
WHAT MR. MATHESON PUT IN THAT REPORT IS A MATTER OF ESTABLISHED SCIENCE.
WE ARE TALKING HERE A MATTER THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF TREATISES THAT ARE
MANY YEARS OLD. IT IS A KNOWN FACT THAT THE EAP MARKER IS VERY LABILE,
THAT A BA DEGRADES TO A B VERY RAPIDLY, AND THE COURT CAN ENVISION IT.
YOU HAVE FOUR BANDS IN THIS MARKER; HEAVY BAND, FAINT BAND, HEAVY BAND,
FAINT BAND. THE FAINT BANDS ARE A, THE HEAVY BANDS ARE B. THE FAINT
BAND, BEING A, DEGRADES FIRST. BA GOES TO B VERY RAPIDLY. IT IS A KNOWN
THING WHICH IS WHY WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE OF DEGRADATION AND YOU HAVE A
B RESULT ON THE EAP, YOU CANNOT EXCLUDE THE BA AND THAT IS SOMETHING
THAT THE JURY HAS BEEN COMPLETELY MISLED ABOUT, NOT TO MENTION THE FACT
THAT AT LEAST ON THE THIGH MARKER WHERE COUNSEL TOLD THE JURY THAT IT
EXCLUDED HER AS WELL, THERE WAS FAINT A ACTIVITY, SO I MEAN --

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK, I'M NOT PREPARED TO REALLY MAKE A RULING AS TO
THE BLOOD ISSUE UNTIL I SEE THE LASER DISK EXHIBIT TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT
THERE IS SOME REAL DANGER OF THE JURY HAVING BEEN MISLED THERE. I WOULD
LIKE TO HEAR YOUR OBSERVATIONS ON MR. BAILEY'S ARGUMENT THAT YOU WERE
AWARE THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOME ALLEGATION THAT MR. SIMPSON WAS
UNABLE TO -- BECAUSE OF HIS ARTHRITIC CONDITION, UNABLE PHYSICALLY TO
EVEN CONTEMPLATE COMMITTING THESE ACTS, WHY IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO YOU,
KNOWING THAT, TO PLAY THE EXERCISE VIDEO DURING YOUR OPENING.

*MS. CLARK:* WHEN DID WE KNOW THAT, YOUR HONOR? WHEN DOES COUNSEL ALLEGE
THAT WE KNEW THAT?

*THE COURT:* WHEN THE MOTION WAS MADE FOR THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO
ADDRESS THE JURY DURING OPENING STATEMENTS AND TO EXHIBIT HIS SCARS.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* WHICH WAS ON MONDAY.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. BEFORE YOUR OPENING.

*MS. CLARK:* WHICH WE OBJECTED TO.

*THE COURT:* BEFORE YOUR OPENING STATEMENT.

*MS. CLARK:* THAT'S RIGHT, WHICH WE OBJECTED TO, BUT BEING ABLE TO SHOW
A SCAR, WHICH IS WHAT MY ARGUMENT WAS TO THE COURT AT THE TIME, HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH DOCTORS WHO ARE GOING TO TESTIFY TO RHEUMATOID
ARTHRITIS. THERE IS WAS NO OFFER OF PROOF FORTHCOMING WITH RESPECT TO
HOW THAT SCAR WAS GOING TO BE LINKED UP. I REPEATEDLY ARGUED TO THE
COURT WHAT IS THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF SHOWING THE JURY A SCAR? BELIEVING
THAT THAT IS ALL THAT THE DEFENSE WOULD DO, I ELECTED AT THAT TIME TO
LET IT BE, BECAUSE I DID NOT THINK THAT COUNSEL -- NOR BECAUSE COUNSEL
DID NOT GIVE US DISCOVERY. THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH BEING SANDBAGGED,
YOUR HONOR. COUNSEL NEVER GAVE US DISCOVERY OF THE FACT THAT THE DOCTORS
WERE GOING TO BE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SPECIALISTS, WERE GOING TO COME
FORWARD AND LINK UP THAT SCAR TO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL IN TERMS OF HIS
PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES ON THAT DAY, AND COUNSEL DELIBERATELY AND
WILLFULLY DID NOT INFORM THE COURT OR THE PROSECUTION OF HIS INTENT TO
LINK UP THAT SCAR TO A DOCTOR'S TESTIMONY. NOW, HOW WAS I ABLE TO
ANTICIPATE WHAT COUNSEL WAS GOING TO DO WHEN HE WILLFULLY WITHHELD THAT
INFORMATION?

*THE COURT:* NOW, MISS CLARK, LET ME ASK YOU ONE OTHER THING. CAN YOU
MAKE AN OFFER OF PROOF TO THE COURT THAT YOU WILL HAVE WITNESSES AS TO
MISS GERCHAS WHO WILL TESTIFY TO INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS SUCH AS TELLING
OTHER PERSONS THAT SHE WAS TRULY NOT THERE, THAT SHE WAS NOT IN FACT
LOOKING FOR A CONDO OR APARTMENT IN THAT AREA, ANY OTHER SPECIFICS
REGARDING CREDIBILITY SPECIFICALLY AS IT COMES TO THIS CASE?

*MS. CLARK:* YES.

*THE COURT:* TELL ME ABOUT THAT. YOU CAN MAKE THAT REPRESENTATION THAT
YOU WILL HAVE THOSE WITNESSES?

*MS. CLARK:* YES, YES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. ANY FURTHER COMMENT, MISS CLARK?

*MS. CLARK:* WITH RESPECT TO -- WITH RESPECT TO ROSA LOPEZ, I CAN ONLY
INDICATE, YOUR HONOR, THAT WE WERE UNFORTUNATELY SANDBAGGED BADLY IN
THAT RESPECT AS WELL. UPON READING THE TRANSCRIPT, I WAS STUNNED TO
REALIZE THAT COUNSEL ATTRIBUTED MANY STATEMENTS TO HER THAT ALLEGEDLY
WERE MADE TO DETECTIVE FUHRMAN ON THE MORNING FOLLOWING THE MURDERS WHEN
IN FACT HIS OWN STATEMENT INDICATES THAT ALL SHE SAID TO DETECTIVE
FUHRMAN WAS SHE HEARD NOISES. IT TOOK AN EXTENSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE REVIEW
OF THE TRANSCRIPT TO REALIZE -- TO GO BACK TO FIND EXACTLY WHAT THOSE
STATEMENTS WERE AND COUNSEL THEN REITERATED IT AGAIN TODAY TO THIS JURY,
WHICH COMPOUNDED THE HARM IN HIS FAILURE TO TURN OVER THAT REPORT WHICH
WE STILL DON'T HAVE. WE STILL HAVE NO STATEMENT INDICATING THAT.

*THE COURT:* MR. COCHRAN, THERE IS NO REPORT ABOUT THAT?

*MR. COCHRAN:* ABSOLUTELY NONE, YOUR HONOR. IF I MIGHT RESPOND?

*THE COURT:* HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THEN?

*MR. COCHRAN:* BECAUSE WE WENT AND TALKED TO THE WITNESS. WE TALKED TO
HER. THEY HAD THE REPORT WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT, YOUR HONOR. THIS IS A
KEY WITNESS OBVIOUSLY, JUDGE. THEY KNOW THAT SHE TALKED TO FUHRMAN THAT
MORNING. DON'T THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION -- DO WE HAVE TO DO THEIR JOB
ALSO, JUDGE? DON'T THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO GO TALK TO HER? I DID.
THAT IS WHAT IS SO AMAZING. WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THEIR INVESTIGATION,
JUDGE. WE ARE THE DEFENSE IN THIS CASE. WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THEIR
INVESTIGATION. THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED, TO HAVE THEM WHINING AND MOANING.
THIS IS OPENING STATEMENT. WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED THE TRIAL, JUDGE, AND
ALL THIS EMOTIONAL VITRIOLIC AND EVERYTHING IS MISLED AND EVERYTHING
THEY DO IS PERFECT AND EVERYTHING WE DO IS WRONG. AND WE ARE JUST DOING
OUR JOB. JUDGE. IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE THAT ALL THESE EXHIBITS AND
ALL THESE THINGS -- AND WANTS TO REHASH EVERYTHING WITH YOU. YOU HAVE
RULED ON THE OTHER THINGS. WE HAVE TO RELITIGATE EVERYTHING OVER AND
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, YOUR HONOR, AND I DON'T THINK THAT IS FAIR. IT IS
NOT FAIR TO MR. SIMPSON.

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR, I AM APPALLED -- YOU KNOW, DOES COUNSEL THINK
IT IS HIS JOB TO MISLEAD AND TO SANDBAG AND TO IGNORE THE LAW AND TO
FLAUNT THE LAW?

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, I'M JUST ASKING FOR -- I JUST ASKED MR. COCHRAN
FOR AN EXPLANATION. IS THERE A STATEMENT OF ROSE LOPEZ THAT CONTAINS THE
-- ATTRIBUTES TO HER THE COMMENTS THAT MR. COCHRAN MADE TODAY AND THE
DAY BEFORE?

*MS. CLARK:* RIGHT. THIS IS THEIR WITNESS.

*THE COURT:* THAT WAS MY QUESTION.

*MS. CLARK:* YEAH. THIS IS THEIR WITNESS AND WHEN THEY TAKE A FURTHER
STATEMENT FROM A WITNESS THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO TURN THAT STATEMENT OVER
AND AS WE ALWAYS HAVE. THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE STATEMENTS FOR SOME
WITNESSES IN OUR CASE AND THE PROSECUTION HAS NEVER BEEN DERELICT IN ITS
DUTY, HAS ALWAYS FULFILLED THAT DUTY TO TURN ALL OF THEM OVER.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK, HERE IS THE PROBLEM: THERE HAS BEEN A
REPRESENTATION MADE TO ME THAT NO SUCH WITNESS STATEMENT WAS TAKEN.

*MS. CLARK:* NEVERTHELESS, OBVIOUSLY THE STATEMENTS WERE MADE, WEREN'T
THEY, AND WE WERE GIVEN NO NOTICE OF THE FACT THAT THE WITNESSES MADE
FURTHER STATEMENTS OF A MUCH DIFFERENT NATURE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WHEN THAT WITNESS IS CALLED, WHEN THAT WITNESS
IS CALLED, YOU MAY MAKE A NEW OBJECTION AND I WILL CONTEMPLATE
PRECLUDING THAT WITNESS FROM TESTIFYING BASED UPON THE FACT THAT IT
APPEARS THAT AT THE TIME OF OPENING STATEMENT THERE WAS A CLEAR INTENT
TO DO THAT, THAT NO STATEMENT WAS IN EXISTENCE, THAT THAT PERSON -- THAT
ADDITIONAL STATEMENT WAS NOT DISCLOSED. I HAVE ALREADY MADE FINDING AS
TO OTHER WITNESSES THAT THIS FAILURE TO DISCLOSE WAS INTENTIONAL AND
DELIBERATE. YOU CAN RENEW YOUR MOTION THEN, BUT AT THIS POINT I'M NOT
GOING TO ENTERTAIN ANY FURTHER SANCTION AS TO ROSA LOPEZ.

*MS. CLARK:* WE WOULD NOT ASK THE COURT TO PRECLUDE HER TESTIMONY, YOUR
HONOR. WE WOULD ASK THAT AN ADMONITION BE GIVEN CONCERNING HER TESTIMONY.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THE COURT WILL RULE AS FOLLOWS: THE PROSECUTION
WILL BE ALLOWED TO BRIEFLY REOPEN ITS OPENING STATEMENT. IT WILL BE
ALLOWED TO GO INTO INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS, SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO
THIS CASE REGARDING MARY ANNE GERCHAS. THE PROSECUTION, BECAUSE THE
DEFENSE DID NOT DISCLOSE THE IDENTITY AND NATURE OF EXPERT WITNESSES WHO
WOULD BE TESTIFYING REGARDING ARTHRITIC CONDITION, MAY MERELY SAY THAT
NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE, WE ARE GOING TO SHOW
YOU THIS VIDEOTAPE OR THESE OUTTAKES. THE PROSECUTION MAY MENTION THE
FACT THAT HOWARD WEITZMAN WAS NOT -- HAVING NOT BEEN DISCLOSED, THAT THE
INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE, THE EVIDENCE YOU WILL PRESENT WILL BE THAT
THAT WAS NOT IN FACT WHAT HAPPENED, THAT MR. WEITZMAN WAS IN FACT
ALLOWED OR HOWEVER YOU FEEL THE EVIDENCE WILL COME OUT AS TO THAT. AS TO
THE ALLEGATIONS OF MISLEADING THE JURY REGARDING THE EAP BLOOD TYPES,
I'M GOING TO DEFER RULING ON THAT UNTIL I HAVE SEEN THE LASER DISK. I'M
GOING TO SUSTAIN THE COURT'S OWN OBJECTION UNDER 352, UNDUE USE OF THE
COURT'S TIME, AS TO THE CIRCLE OF BENEVOLENCE ARGUMENT AND THE TAFT
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT, BECAUSE THERE IS ANY SUBSTANTIAL -- THAT IS A
MATTER OF INTERPRETATION THAT CAN BE DONE THROUGH THE EVIDENCE AND NOT
THROUGH PRESENTATION OF ARGUMENT THROUGH OPENING STATEMENT. AND MISS
CLARK, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A TEN-MINUTE TIME LIMIT ON THAT.

*MS. CLARK:* VERY WELL, YOUR HONOR, BUT WE ARE GOING TO NEED -- I WOULD
LIKE FOR THE COURT TO -- I WOULD LIKE TO AWAIT THE PRESENTATION OF THE
OPENING STATEMENT UNTIL WE KNOW THE COURT'S DECISION ON THE BLOOD ISSUE.

*THE COURT:* THAT IS A MUCH DIFFERENT ISSUE. THAT DOESN'T GO TO
SANDBAGGING AT DISCOVERY. THAT GOES TO THE SHOW AND TELL ISSUE. THAT IS
A DIFFERENT ISSUE.

*MS. CLARK:* BUT THE RESOLUTION IS THE SAME REALLY.

*THE COURT:* NOT REALLY.

*MS. CLARK:* WHAT OTHER RESOLUTION COULD THERE BE?

*THE COURT:* WELL, THAT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ISSUE THAT I'M NOT
GOING TO ENTERTAIN UNTIL I SEE THE LASER DISK. ALL RIGHT? BUT WE HAVE AN
HOUR LEFT OF COURT TIME. THERE ARE OTHER SANCTIONS THAT I CAN IMPOSE
BESIDES THAT, BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT I NEED -- THAT A SANCTION IS
APPROPRIATE IN THAT CASE.

*MS. CLARK:* WITH RESPECT TO THAT LASER DISK?

*THE COURT:* THAT'S CORRECT. I WANT TO SEE THE EXHIBIT ITSELF. IF THE
EXHIBIT -- THIS IS MY THOUGHT ON THAT: IF THE EXHIBIT, ALTHOUGH
HIGHLIGHTS ONE SECTION, IF THE REST OF THE SENTENCE IS VISIBLE AND THERE
IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE AVAILABLE THAT WAS EXHIBITED FOR A LONG PERIOD OF
TIME IN GREAT DETAIL TO THE JURY, IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN MISLEADING IN
THAT CONTEXT. AND MISS CLARK, PLEASE DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME. I REALIZE
THE PRESSURES THAT YOU ARE UNDER, BOTH PROFESSIONALLY AND OTHERWISE, AND
I REALLY APPRECIATE THEM, BUT AT SOME POINT IN TIME WHEN WE HAVE OUR
SHOW AND TELL AND WE MAKE RULINGS AND WE AGREE NOT TO -- WE WAIVE
OBJECTION TO THINGS, THAT SHOULD BE THE END OF IT.

*MS. CLARK:* I APPRECIATE THAT, YOUR HONOR. I THINK THAT --

*THE COURT:* I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART. I AGREE WITH
YOU THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, BUT I NEED TO SEE IT BEFORE I CAN RULE
ON IT. I AM GIVING YOU SOMETHING THAT IS VIRTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED IN ANY
CRIMINAL CASE I HAVE EVER SEEN, THE OPPORTUNITY TO REOPEN, BUT IT IS A
SANCTION I THINK THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ME WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF 115, BUT
THOSE ARE THE ONLY THREE ITEMS THAT I WILL ALLOW YOU TO REOPEN ON AND
YOU HAVE A TEN-MINUTE TIME LIMIT.

*MS. CLARK:* ALL RIGHT. THAT'S FINE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. NOW, AFTER WE HAVE FINISHED THAT, THEN WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO PRESENT? I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A TAPE-RECORDING I NEED TO
LISTEN TO.

*MS. CLARK:* YES.

*THE COURT:* WHAT IS THAT? TAPE-RECORDING OF WHAT?

*MS. CLARK:* LET ME DEFER.

*THE COURT:* MR. DARDEN.

*MR. BAILEY:* WHILE SHE IS DOING THAT, YOUR HONOR, TWO MATTERS: WE HAVE
NOT SEEN ANY VIDEO OUTTAKES. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM BEFORE THE JURY
DOES, AND I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST, YOUR HONOR, THAT YOU MIGHT WISH TO
REPEAT THE EXHORTATIONS THAT COUNSEL MADE ON THE OPENING DAY. I DO NOT
BELIEVE THAT PERSONALLY DIRECTED EPITHETS ADD ANY GRACE WHATSOEVER TO
THIS PROCEEDING.

*THE COURT:* I WAS ACTUALLY -- MR. BAILEY, I THINK I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF
TIME JUMPING ON THEM TODAY, SO I WAS WAITING FOR ONE OF YOU TO DO THAT
SO I CAN JUMP ON YOU TO MAKE THE POINT, SO --

*MR. BAILEY:* WE PREFER THE HIGH ROAD.

*THE COURT:* -- I HAVE TO BALANCE MY EXCORIATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME.

*MR. DARDEN:* YOU WANTED SOME INFORMATION?

*THE COURT:* YES. MR. DARDEN, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU IS YOU
INDICATED TO ME AT SIDE BAR OFF THE RECORD THAT YOU WERE GOING TO
PRESENT APPARENTLY THE AUDIOTAPE OF THE 1989 OR 1985 911 CALL.

*MR. DARDEN:* YEAH, THE 911 CALL FROM 1989.

*THE COURT:* 1989?

*MR. DARDEN:* YES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. AND ALSO YOU INDICATED THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE
REOPENED OPENING STATEMENT THAT YOU WERE GOING TO PRESENT OUTTAKES FROM
AN EXERCISE VIDEO; IS THAT CORRECT?

*MR. DARDEN:* THAT'S CORRECT.

*THE COURT:* WHEN DID YOU RECEIVE THOSE OUTTAKES?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. DARDEN:* WE RECEIVED THE OUTTAKES SOME DAYS AGO AND WE PRESSED THEM
ON TO A LASER DISK YESTERDAY.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT THEY ARE. LET'S SEE WHAT
THEY ARE.

*MR. DARDEN:* ALSO, THERE IS A CUT VERSION OF THE ROY FIRESTONE
INTERVIEW WHICH THEY HAVE NOT SEEN.

*THE COURT:* IT IS CALLED EDITED.

*MR. DARDEN:* EDITED.

*MR. DOUGLAS:* ANYTHING ELSE, YOUR HONOR?

*MR. BAILEY:* MR. COCHRAN --

*MR. DARDEN:* I ADVISED MR. COCHRAN OF THE FIRESTONE INTERVIEW, EDITED,
EARLIER.

*THE COURT:* MR. BAILEY, YOU HAD A COMMENT?

*MR. BAILEY:* YES, YOUR HONOR. MR. COCHRAN HAS SUGGESTED TO ME, AND I
ENDORSE THE NOTION THAT IN FAIRNESS TO A WITNESS WHO IS BEING BATTERED
ALL OVER THE COURTROOM FOR MERELY HAVING THE UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE OF
BEING A WITNESS, THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A HEARING ON THESE ALLEGED
IMPEACHING WITNESSES TO SEE IF THEY EXIST AND WHAT THEY REALLY SAY
BEFORE THE JURY IS GIVEN THAT TAINT, WHICH CAN'T UNDO FOR THREE MONTHS.
COULD THEY BE BROUGHT IN AND APPEAR BEFORE YOUR HONOR JUST LONG ENOUGH
TO ASSURE US THAT THEY EXIST AND THEY HAVE SUCH TESTIMONY TO GIVE?
PRETTY GOOD JOB HAS BEEN DONE ON MARY ANNE GERCHAS THUS FAR. WE ARE
GOING TO FIND OUR WITNESSES GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES PRETTY SOON.

*THE COURT:* I WILL THINK ABOUT THAT, BUT AT THIS POINT LET ME SEE THESE
OTHER ITEMS. DO WE HAVE THE LASER DISK OF THE --

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* YES, YOUR HONOR. THIS IS A FULL CUE TAPE OF THE
TEN-MINUTE SEGMENTS OF OUTTAKES.

*MR. DARDEN:* BEFORE WE PLAY THAT, CAN WE APPROACH WITHOUT THE REPORTER
FOR A MOMENT?

*THE COURT:* SURE.

(A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH, NOT REPORTED.)

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT:)

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. ALL RIGHT. I HAVE BEEN
ADVISED THAT THE OUTTAKE MATERIAL IS STILL COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL, SO ITS
RELEASED TO THE OUTSIDE VIDEO FEED WILL BE INTERRUPTED FOR THE PLAYING
OF THIS ITEM.

*MR. DARDEN:* AS I UNDERSTAND IT, YOUR HONOR, THIS WILL LAST
APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, IT IS TEN MINUTES AFTER 4:00 RIGHT NOW.
I STILL NEED TO HEAR THE AUDIOTAPE, STILL NEED TO HEAR ARGUMENT, ET
CETERA, ET CETERA, ON THAT. I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO FINISH WITH
THE JURY TODAY. MY INCLINATION IS TO SEND THEM OUT AT THIS POINT.

*MR. BAILEY:* I AGREE, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. DARDEN:* AS FAR AS THE AUDIOTAPE IS CONCERNED, I ASSUME IT IS THE
SAME AUDIOTAPE THE COURT LISTENED TO REGARDING BACK WHEN WE DID THE
MOTION IN LIMINE REGARDING THE DV HEARING.

*THE COURT:* BY THE TIME WE FINISH THIS ARGUMENT ON THE OUTTAKES,
OBJECTION WITH SPECIFICS, IT WILL BE 4:30. DEPUTY MAGNERA, WHY DON'T YOU
CALL UP AND LET THE JURY LOOSE FOR THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU.

*DEPUTY MAGNERA:* YES, SIR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE THE OUTTAKES.

(4:09 A VIDEOTAPE, OUTTAKES, WAS PLAYED.)

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* THERE IS A SECOND PART TO THIS CLIP.

(THE VIDEOTAPE CONTINUES PLAYING.)

(AT 4:19 P.M. THE PLAYING OF THE VIDEOTAPE CONCLUDED.)

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* THAT WAS THE END OF THE SEGMENT.

*THE COURT:* WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE?

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* WE ALSO HAVE THE SEGMENT FROM THE ROY FIRESTONE
INTERVIEW.

*THE COURT:* LET'S DO THAT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* I WILL NEED TO CHANGE LASER DISKS.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* WHAT IS THE COPYRIGHT STATUS OF THIS MATERIAL?

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* YOUR HONOR, I'M NOT SURE AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

*MR. BAILEY:* NEWS BROADCAST, WASN'T IT? THERE IS NO COPYRIGHT ON A NEWS
BROADCAST.

*THE COURT:* READY?

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* MAY I PROCEED?

*THE COURT:* SURE.

(AT 4:20 P.M. A VIDEOTAPE WAS PLAYED.)

(AT 4:21 P.M. THE PLAYING OF THE VIDEOTAPE CONCLUDED.)

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* THAT IS THE END OF THIS PARTICULAR SEGMENT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. HOW LONG IS THE AUDIOTAPE?

*MR. DARDEN:* A COUPLE MINUTES.

*THE COURT:* I'M SORRY?

*MS. CLARK:* A COUPLE MINUTES.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* YOUR HONOR, I'M REMOVING THE TAPE FROM AN EXHIBIT THAT
HAS ALREADY BEEN SENT TO COURT. IT IS A TAPE LABELED "P-55."

*MR. DARDEN:* I SHOULD INDICATE THAT THE DISPATCHER WILL BE HERE TO
TESTIFY AND SHE WILL AUTHENTICATE THE TAPE.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* IF I MAY HAVE A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR, I'M NOT QUITE
FAMILIAR WITH THIS NEW TAPE DECK.

*MR. BAILEY:* WHILE HE IS SEARCHING FOR THE GOODS, YOUR HONOR, WHAT IS
THIS REMEDIAL TO? OBVIOUSLY MR. DARDEN COULD HAVE PLAYED IT IN HIS
OPENING AND DECIDED NOT TO.

*THE COURT:* NO, NO. THIS IS THE -- YOU OBJECTED AND LODGED AN OBJECTION
AS TO TO THIS. THIS IS PART OF OUR 402 HEARING AS TO THE TAPE.

*MR. BAILEY:* OKAY. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH REOPENING?

*THE COURT:* I FIGURED SINCE WE ARE HERE, WE SENT THE JURY HOME, WE GOT
ALL THE EQUIPMENT, WE MIGHT AS WELL LISTEN TO IT ALL AT ONE TIME.

*MR. COCHRAN:* JUDGE, ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO US AT SOME POINT IN
TIME ABOUT THE VIDEO?

*MR. BAILEY:* IS THE FIRESTONE TAPE ALSO SOMETHING COMING INTO EVIDENCE
AND NOT FOR REOPENING?

*MR. DARDEN:* YES.

*THE COURT:* THE ONLY THING WE WATCHED FOR PURPOSES OF REOPENING IS THE
WORKOUT TAPE.

*MR. BAILEY:* AS TO THAT, I ASSUME IF YOU PERMIT THEM TO DESCRIBE IT AND
SHOW IT IN REOPENING, IT WILL BE ON A COMMITMENT THAT IT WILL BE
INTRODUCED IN THE CASE IN CHIEF AND IT IS ADMISSIBLE FOR ALL PURPOSES
AND NOT SOME LIMITED PURSUANCE?

*THE COURT:* I ASSUME SO.

*MS. CLARK:* DID YOU RELEASE THE JURY, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MS. CLARK:* WERE THEY ADMONISHED?

*THE COURT:* YES, THEY WERE.

*MS. CLARK:* OKAY. I DON'T HEAR IT ANY MORE. THANK YOU.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* YOUR HONOR, WE BELIEVE WE SOLVED THE TECHNICAL
PROBLEM. IT WAS A MISPLACED PLUG.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. PROCEED.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* ALL RIGHT. WE ARE READY TO PROCEED.

*THE COURT:* I NEED A LITTLE MORE VOLUME ON THAT.

(AT 4:25 P.M. AN AUDIOTAPE WAS PLAYED.)

(AT 4:28 PLAYING OF THE AUDIOTAPE CONCLUDED.)

*MR. DARDEN:* WE APPARENTLY TURNED THE VOLUME UP DURING THE MIDDLE OF
THE SCREAMS. AS I SAID, THE DISPATCHER WILL BE HERE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, I CAN'T TELL. WHAT WAS THE PART HE WANTED TO
HEAR?

*MR. DARDEN:* YOU WANTED TO HEAR THE TAPE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* IT IS NOT CLEAR, YOUR HONOR, WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO HEAR.
DID WE PLAY THE WHOLE THING?

*MR. DARDEN:* NO, THERE IS MORE, THAT RELATES TO OTHER CALLS.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT HE SAID WE WERE
GOING TO HEAR SLAPS.

*MR. DARDEN:* YOU WILL.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WHO IS GOING TO IDENTIFY AND AUTHENTICATE THAT? WHO DO
THEY HAVE WHO WAS THERE THAT CAN IDENTIFY AND AUTHENTICATE SLAPS?

*MR. DARDEN:* THE DISPATCHER. AND IF YOU LISTEN TO THE TAPE, YOU CAN
HEAR IT, TOO, AND AS I SAID, I THINK WE TURN THE VOLUME UP DURING THE
MIDDLE OF THE SCREAM.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET ME HEAR IT AT THE TOP THEN BECAUSE
THAT IS ALL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TAPE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT AGAIN, YOUR HONOR. HOW CAN THE
DISPATCHER TELL US THEY ARE SLAPS? SHE CAN'T DO THAT.

*THE COURT:* THAT IS WHY WE ARE HAVING A 402 HEARING, MR. COCHRAN.

*MR. DARDEN:* THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A JURY.

*THE COURT:* I UNDERSTAND THE POINT, COUNSEL, BUT LET'S LISTEN TO THE
TAPE. SOME THINGS ARE --

*MR. DARDEN:* DID YOU HEAR THE SCREAMING, THOUGH?

*MR. COCHRAN:* I DIDN'T STAND UP AND WHINE AND MOAN WHEN HE MADE THAT
STATEMENT, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. DARDEN:* I'M NOT WHINING AND MOANING, MR. COCHRAN.

*THE COURT:* NOW YOU ARE GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. GENTLEMAN, REALLY
THIS IS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL, AND LADIES, THIS IS GETTING OUT OF
CONTROL GOING BACK AND FORTH. YOU CAN MAYBE THE SAME POINTS. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ENGAGE IN THE PERSONAL INVECTIVE. THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAT
REALLY IRRITATES ME. I'M VERY PATIENT, I LET YOU GUYS TALK A LOT, BUT
THE THING THAT IRRITATES ME IS THE PERSONAL INVECTIVE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S
HEAR IT FROM THE TOP.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* IT IS NEARLY REWOUND.

*THE COURT:* I'M SORRY?

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* IT IS NEARLY REWOUND.

*THE COURT:* OKAY.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

(AT 4:30 P.M. THE AUDIOTAPE WAS AGAIN PLAYED.)

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* SHALL I REPLAY THAT SEGMENT, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* LET ME ASK YOU THIS, MR. DARDEN: WHAT IS THE -- WHAT
GENERATION TAPE IS THIS? IS THIS A FIRST GENERATION OFF THE LARGE
24-HOUR REEL-TO-REEL THAT LAPD HAS?

*MR. DARDEN:* IT IS A SECOND GENERATION TAPE, I BELIEVE, OFF THE
REEL-TO-REEL.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* SHALL I PROCEED?

*THE COURT:* PLEASE.

(AT 4:31 P.M. THE AUDIOTAPE WAS AGAIN PLAYED.)

(AT 4:32 THE PLAYING OF THE AUDIOTAPE CONCLUDED.)

*THE COURT:* OKAY. I'VE HEARD THAT PART. THANK YOU.

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I BE HEARD ON THAT, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* I'M SORRY?

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I BE HEARD ON THAT?

*THE COURT:* LET ME SEE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE GOT AND LET'S DO ALL THE
SHOW AND TELL AND THEN WE WILL TAKE THEM ONE AT A TIME. MR. HARRIS, SO
GOOD OF YOU TO COME BACK.

*MR. DARDEN:* IN ANY EVENT, I SHOULD INDICATE TO YOU, WORKING WITH THE
CONTROL WE WILL FILTER OUT SOME OF THE NOISE AND YOU WILL HEAR, AS THE
DISPATCHER HEARD JUST LAST WEEK, AS DID OTHER DISPATCHERS HEAR, AS I DID
HEAR AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS OFFICE, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR IT.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, I INDICATED I WANTED TO SEE ALL THE EXHIBITS FIRST.

*MR. DARDEN:* THAT IS IT.

*THE COURT:* MR. HARRIS IS NOW HERE WITH THE FAMOUS LASER DISK.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

(AT 4:34 P.M. THE LASER DISK WAS DISPLAYED.)

*THE COURT:* LET ME KNOW IF YOU ARE GOING TO BRING UP A VICTIM'S BODY
AGAIN.

*MR. HARRIS:* I'M SORRY, THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*MR. HARRIS:* THAT'S IT.

*THE COURT:* I HOPE THE DELAY PERSON CAUGHT THAT. ALL RIGHT. LET ME SEE
THE ORIGINAL. DO YOU HAVE THE FULL REPORT WITHOUT THE EMPHASIZED
PORTION, MR. HARRIS?

*MS. CLARK:* RIGHT HERE.

*THE COURT:* NO, NO.

(BRIEF PAUSE.)

*THE COURT:* OKAY. ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL, JUST SO WE UNDERSTAND THE
PARAMETERS OF WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE, AS FAR AS THE QUESTION FOR
REOPENING OF OPENING STATEMENTS BY THE PROSECUTION, THE ISSUE WAS THE
COURT WANTED TO SEE THE WORKOUT TAPE, SO-CALLED OUTTAKES, THAT THE
PROSECUTION WISHES TO PRESENT BECAUSE THE TESTIMONY REGARDING EXPERT
WITNESSES REGARDING THE DEFENDANT'S ARTHRITIC CONDITION WERE NOT
DISCLOSED TO THEM PRIOR TO THE OPENING STATEMENTS, THEN ALSO THE
PROSECUTION WANTED LEAVE OF THE COURT TO COMPLETE THE PICTURES,
QUOTE-UNQUOTE, FAR AS THE EAP BLOOD TYPE. AND I REVIEWED THE EXHIBIT
JUST NOW, SO LET'S SETTLE THE ISSUE OF REOPENING OPENING STATEMENT AND
THEN I WILL HEAR THE 402 OBJECTIONS TO THE EVIDENCE. MISS CLARK.

*MS. CLARK:* YES, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* WORKOUT TAPE AND THE EAP ITEM.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* I THOUGHT THAT WORKOUT TAPE WAS RESOLVED.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SAY IN
SUPPORT OF THE TAPE?

*MS. CLARK:* SUPPORT OF THE WORKOUT TAPE, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MS. CLARK:* ONLY -- I THINK I HAVE --

*THE COURT:* MR. COCHRAN, THOSE TWO ITEMS, LASER DISK AND THE WORKOUT TAPE?

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. AND I WILL BE VERY BRIEF, YOUR
HONOR. WITH REGARD TO THE WORKOUT TAPE, I MEAN, WE ALL SAW THE WORKOUT
TAPE, AND I THINK THAT I WILL SUBMIT IT EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THERE WAS
SOME PART, SOME MOMENT OF LEVITY ABOUT GIVING YOUR WIFE ROOM OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT IS RELEVANT TO ANYTHING AT
ALL. THE LATTER PART WHERE MR. SIMPSON IS TALKING TO THE TRAINER
APPARENTLY AND SAYING YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOUR WIFE ROOM OR SOMETHING LIKE
THAT, SOME STATEMENT WHEN THEY ARE MOVING THE ARM, I DON'T KNOW IF THE
COURT NOTED THAT, I DON'T THINK THAT IS RELEVANT AND I THINK THAT COULD
BE AMBIGUOUS AND MISCONSTRUED. THE --

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN DEFENSE COUNSEL.)

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOU CAN TURN THE AUDIO OFF AT THAT POINT IF YOU WANTED TO
JUST SHOW IT. HOW WOULD YOU NEED THE AUDIO AT THAT POINT? IN ADDITION TO
THAT, I STILL FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE SAID THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO
DO THIS IN A RE-REOPENING WHICH THE COURT HAS ALREADY SAID IS SO UNUSUAL.

*THE COURT:* WELL --

*MR. COCHRAN:* LET ME ADD ONE THING, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* SURE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* AS I INDICATED TO THE COURT BEFORE, ONE OF THE
ADVANTAGES, AND I THINK THIS SEEMS TO GET LOST SO VERY OFTEN HERE, IS
THAT WHO WOULD KNOW BETTER THAN O.J. SIMPSON THAT HE HAS RHEUMATOID
ARTHRITIS, IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE DOCTORS WHO HAVE
TREATED HIM SO WE WOULD KNOW THAT, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS TAPE HELPS
WITH THE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. HE TALKS ABOUT HIS KNEES, HE TALKS ABOUT
THOSE THINGS. SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT, SO IF YOU DO THINK
THAT IT IS RELEVANT AND SHOULD BE DONE, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I THINK WE
ARE STRETCHING IT, NO. 1, BUT SECONDLY, ANY CONVERSATION WITH REGARD TO
YOUR WIFE OR GIVING YOUR WIFE ROOM OR WHATEVER THAT STATEMENT WAS, WE
MAY WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AGAIN, I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPROPER AND
AMBIGUOUS AND WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE TO BE SHOWN TO THE JURY. THE
OTHER ASPECT YOU ASKED ME TO ADDRESS WHICH IS WITH REGARD TO THE EAP
BLOOD. AS THE COURT CAN SEE, IN THE SHOW AND TELL IT IS HOOKED INTO THE
LASER DISK, PUT THE WHOLE -- WE PUT THE WHOLE EXHIBIT UP, TOOK OUT THE
PORTION. THE COURT COULD SEE WHAT WE TOOK OUT. IT WAS SHOWN TO MISS
CLARK AND IT WAS SHOWN TO EVERYBODY. THIS IDEA THAT THEY WERE RUSHING,
THAT IS NOT TRUTH AT ALL. THEY WERE SHOWN THIS AND THEY LOOKED AT IT
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE. THEY CONTINUED TO OBJECT. EVEN TO GIVE YOU AN
EXAMPLE, YOUR HONOR, THIS MORNING MISS CLARK HAS THIS SELECTED MEMORY.
SHE HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE FUHRMAN THING. OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF
CAUTION AGAIN TOLD YOU ABOUT FUHRMAN AND SHE RECALLED THAT AND SHE
ARGUED ABOUT VANNATTER AND SAID SHE COULDN'T DO THAT AND YOU ALREADY
RULED ON THAT. SHE WILL REARGUE EVERYTHING. I THINK THAT IS THE POINT
WITH THE EAP. WE MADE THIS CLEAR AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS TO TALK
ABOUT MISLEADING. WE DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACTS THAT WHENEVER
EVERYTHING POINTS AWAY FROM THEIR THEORY OF GUILT TOWARDS INNOCENCE. AND
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BEING DEGRADED, YOUR HONOR. THERE WILL BE A
LOT OF EVIDENCE ABOUT POSSIBLE DEGRADING, BUT AGAIN, THAT IS THEIR --
THAT IS THEIR QUALIFIER, THAT IS THEIR SPECULATION. WE DON'T HAVE TO
ACCEPT THAT. WE TOOK THE POINT THAT WAS MADE AT THAT POINT, IF THE COURT
PLEASES, AND I THINK IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR, FIRST OF ALL, WITH RESPECT TO THE VIDEOTAPE, I
THINK THE STATEMENT THAT IS MADE BY MR. SIMPSON IS RELEVANT AND SHOULD
BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN.

*THE COURT:* WELL, THAT GOES TO A DIFFERENT ISSUE. YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR
NOT IT IS RELEVANT TO ISSUES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FLIPPANT COMMENTS
MADE ABOUT SPOUSAL ABUSE, THAT IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE. YOU WANT TO USE IT
TO REOPEN REGARDING ARTHRITIS. THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE ASKED FOR AND NOT
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE FIRST SEGMENT DEALS WITH A WORKOUT. THE SECOND
SEGMENT CONTAINS I THINK THE COMMENT, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, SINCE THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME I HAVE SEEN IT.

*MR. DARDEN:* YES.

*MS. CLARK:* YES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. IF THE ISSUE IS THE ARTHRITIS, AT THIS TIME I'M
INCLINED TO ALLOW YOU TO USE THE FIRST SEGMENT ONLY.

*MS. CLARK:* FOR THE PRESENTATION?

*THE COURT:* FOR THE PRESENTATION. NOW --

*MS. CLARK:* WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE THE SOUND OUT SINCE THE ISSUE IS THE
ARTHRITIS FOR THE OPENING? WOULDN'T THAT RESOLVE IT?

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* NO. MAY I BE HEARD?

*THE COURT:* SURE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* ABSOLUTELY NOT. WHERE HE TALKS -- WE WANT THE SOUND OUT
BECAUSE HE SAID I'VE GOT THESE BAD KNEES, CAN'T USE THESE KNEES? WHAT IS
THIS? I THINK THAT WOULD BE TOTALLY UNFAIR.

*THE COURT:* FIRST SEGMENT.

*MS. CLARK:* YOUR HONOR --

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* THIS IS OUR CASE IN CHIEF, YOUR HONOR. COUNSEL CAN PUT THIS
WHEREVER THEY WANT TO PUT IN WHEN IT IS THEIR TURN.

*THE COURT:* MISS CLARK, HERE IS THE PROBLEM: SECOND SEGMENT CLEARLY HAS
PROBLEMS WITH THAT STATEMENT. I'M NOT SAYING IT IS NOT COMING IN, BUT
THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE YOU NEED IT FOR THE OPENING STATEMENT.

*MS. CLARK:* RIGHT.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. SO YOU ARE ASKING FOR TOO MUCH TO GET THAT IN AT
THIS POINT. THE FIRST SEGMENT SHOWS MR. SIMPSON DOING VARIOUS EXERCISES,
STRETCHING. HE MENTIONED THE KNEES. THAT IS WHAT YOU NEED. THAT IS WHAT
YOU WANT FOR YOUR OPENING STATEMENT. THAT IS WHAT YOU CAN HAVE.

*MS. CLARK:* IS THE COURT REQUIRING US TO USE SOUND?

*THE COURT:* THAT IS WHAT IT IS. YOU WANT A VIDEOTAPE, YOU TAKE IT THE
WAY IT IS.

*MS. CLARK:* WE -- YOUR HONOR, IF WE DON'T WANT TO USE THE SOUND, IT IS
EASY TO TAKE OUT. WE CAN SIMPLY --

*THE COURT:* BUT THEN IT IS A MISREPRESENTATION OF WHAT IS THERE, ISN'T IT?

*MS. CLARK:* I'M SORRY.

*THE COURT:* THEN IT IS A MISREPRESENTATION AS TO WHAT IT IS.

*MS. CLARK:* KIND OF LIKE WHAT COUNSEL DID, YOU MEAN?

*THE COURT:* DO YOU WANT TO USE IT OR NOT? YES OR NO? USE THE VIDEOTAPE,
DON'T USE THE VIDEOTAPE, IT IS UP TO YOU. THE FIRST SEGMENT, THAT IS ALL
I'M GOING TO ALLOW IS BECAUSE THAT IS ALL IT GOES TO IS THE ARTHRITIC
CONDITION.

*MS. CLARK:* MAY I HAVE A MOMENT, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* SURE.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MS. CLARK:* OKAY. WE WILL USE IT.

*THE COURT:* OKAY. THE SECOND THING IS THE EAP, THE THING ON THE LASER
DISK. I HAVE SEEN IT NOW. ANY OTHER COMMENT?

*MS. CLARK:* I THINK THE COURT CAN SEE HOW MISLEADING IT IS AND I ONLY
WANTED TO INDICATE TO THE COURT THAT THE DEFENSE VIOLATED THE COURT
ORDER REGARDING THE SHOW AND TELL SHOWING UP LATE WITH IT ON MONDAY. I
DO NOT RECALL HAVING SEEN IT, BUT WE WERE HIT WITH SO MUCH AT THE LAST
MINUTE AND AS A RESULT OF THE DEFENSE VIOLATION OF THE COURT'S ORDER AS
TO WHEN THOSE EXHIBITS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWN TO US, WE WERE PRESSED
IN OR EXAMINING A HUGE NUMBER OF EXHIBITS ALL AT THE LAST MINUTE WITH
ABOUT SECOND FOR EACH ONE. THE RESULT OF A DEFENSE VIOLATION OF A COURT
ORDER SHOULD NOT BE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE GUN AND HELD THEIR
FEET TO THE FIRE. THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE RESULT. THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE
ENTITLED TO EXAMINE THINGS IN A MORE LEISURELY FASHION. AND THE
DEFENDANT IS SIMPLY PUSHING THE COURT AND PUSHING THE COURT IN ORDER TO
GET THE COURT TO PUSH THE PROSECUTION UNFAIRLY IN ORDER TO GAIN MORE
TACTICAL ADVANTAGE WHICH IS WHAT THEY DID EXACTLY WITH THE EXHIBIT AS
WELL. IT IS A VERY CONSISTENT PATTERN HERE. WE HAVE A CONSTANT EFFORT TO
SANDBAG AND TAKE THE PROSECUTION BY SURPRISE AND TRY AND MAKE THIS A
TRIAL BY AMBUSH. THEY DON'T WANT THE TRUTH TO COME OUT. THEY WANT TO PUT
A STRANGLEHOLD ON US SO THAT WE CANNOT MEET THEIR EVIDENCE AND MEET
THEIR REPRESENTATIONS AND THAT IS WHY EVERYTHING IS BEING HIDDEN AND
POPPED OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE, TOO MANY LAST MINUTE SURPRISES. AND
NOBODY IS PERFECT, YOUR HONOR. YOU KNOW, IF WE MADE A MISTAKE, THEN I
APOLOGIZE TO THE COURT. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE DO THINGS IN A
HURRY. MISTAKES GET MADE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MISS CLARK. ALL RIGHT. THE COURT'S
RULING -- I'M SORRY.

*MR. COCHRAN:* ONE THING TO THE COURT. THIS WAS ARGUED ON THE 23RD. THE
COURT DIDN'T EVEN RULE ON THIS UNTIL THE 24TH I THINK YOU WILL FIND THE
RECORD WILL SHOW.

*THE COURT:* COUNSEL, THE COURT'S RULING STANDS AS TO THE PROSECUTION
MOTION TO REOPEN. THEY WILL BE ALLOWED TO REOPEN AS TO MISS GERCHAS, AS
TO THE INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS. THEY WILL BE ALLOWED TO REOPEN TO SHOW
THE FIRST SEGMENT OF THE WORKOUT VIDEOTAPE. THEY WILL BE ALLOWED TO
REOPEN AS TO THE -- AS TO MR. WEITZMAN SINCE MR. WEITZMAN WAS NEITHER ON
THE WITNESS LIST OR DISCLOSED PRIOR TO THE OPENING STATEMENTS. I AM
GOING TO SUSTAIN THE OBJECTION TO REOPENING AS TO THE EAP BLOOD TYPE.
ALL RIGHT. LET'S DISCUSS THEN IN THE OPENING STATEMENT -- EXCUSE ME --
THE PROSECUTION'S FIRST WITNESSES.

*MR. COCHRAN:* YOUR HONOR, CAN I SAY ONE THING TO THE COURT? WITH REGARD
TO JUST ONE THING, MAY I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

*THE COURT:* CERTAINLY. CLARIFICATION, QUESTION?

*MR. COCHRAN:* QUESTION, QUESTION. THE QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH, YOUR
HONOR, THE COURT INDICATED THAT HE WASN'T ON THE WITNESS LIST OR
WHATEVER. I AM INDICATING TO THE COURT, HE WASN'T ON THE WITNESS LIST
BUT FOR THE PROSECUTION TO MAKE THE STATEMENT I'M REPRESENTING TO THE
COURT MR. WEITZMAN IS GOING TO SAY ALONG WITH MR. TAFT THAT HE WAS ASKED
TO LEAVE AND WAS NOT ALLOWED IN THAT ROOM.

*THE COURT:* AND I ASSUME THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SAY --

*MR. COCHRAN:* THEY ARE GOING TO SAY THAT --

*THE COURT:* -- THAT DEFENSE COUNSEL MADE THIS REPRESENTATION TO YOU. WE
ARE GOING TO PRESENT WITNESSES WHO ARE GOING TO TELL YOU THAT THAT IS
NOT TRUE. THIS IS WHAT OUR EVIDENCE IS GOING TO SHOW. AND THAT IS ALL
THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAY. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE, BECAUSE
WEITZMAN, IF THE COURT ALLOWS, IS GOING TO BE COMING IN, ALONG WITH SKIP
TAFT AND OTHERS, WHO WILL SAY ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED.

*THE COURT:* I SUSPECT SO. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR.

*THE COURT:* IT IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. AS TO THE ROY FIRESTONE TAPE, ANY COMMENT, MR.
COCHRAN?

*MR. COCHRAN:* YES. WE ARE NOW TO THE TRIAL EVIDENCE, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* THAT IS CORRECT. TWO ISSUES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE ARE
THE 911 TAPE AND THE ROY FIRESTONE TAPE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* LET ME TAKE -- YOU ASKED ME ABOUT ROY FIRESTONE FIRST.
LET ME TAKE ROY FIRESTONE FIRST. IT IS A TELEVISION INTERVIEW, YOUR
HONOR, AND I'M NOT CLEAR FOR WHAT PURPOSE THIS IS OFFERED. IT SEEMS TO
ME THAT IF THEY ARE GOING TO CALL ROY FIRESTONE, I'M NOT SURE IF THEY
ARE CALLING ROY FIRESTONE OR THEY ARE JUST PLAYING THE TAPE. IT SEEMS TO
ME THEY WOULD HAVE TO CALL ROY FIRESTONE AS OPPOSED TO JUST PLAYING THE
TAPE OR IS THERE GOING TO BE A COMBINATION THERE OF? MAY I ASK THAT
QUESTION FIRST? WHAT RELEVANCE -- ARE YOU GOING TO PLAY A TAPE AND THAT
IS ALL THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?

*THE COURT:* I DON'T KNOW. MR. DARDEN.

*MR. DARDEN:* I THINK THE TAPE IS SELF-AUTHENTICATING. I DON'T THINK I
HAVE TO CALL ROY FIRESTONE. IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. EITHER THAT IS O.J.
SIMPSON OR IT IS AN IMPOSTER.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WELL, THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO WE CROSS-EXAMINE THE TAPE?
THAT TAPE IS CUT AFTER AN INTERVIEW. WHEN YOU GO -- IF THE COURT IS
AWARE, WHEN YOU DO AN INTERVIEW -- I SHOULDN'T USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE,
SHOULD I, YOUR HONOR? FORGIVE ME, YOUR HONOR. WHEN ONE DOES AN INTERVIEW
SOMETIMES THEY LAST LIKE FIVE DAYS OR WHATEVER, YOU KNOW. LET ME TELL
YOU, JUDGE, THEY CUT THESE INTERVIEWS.

*THE COURT:* OH, MR. COCHRAN, YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO HURT A GUY.

*MR. COCHRAN:* NO, YOUR HONOR. NO, NO, YOUR HONOR, NO. THE POINT I WAS
TRYING TO MAKE, YOUR HONOR, WAS THAT THIS INTERVIEW IS CUT IN A
PARTICULAR FASHION TO BE OVER, LET'S SAY, A 22-MINUTE PERIOD OF TIME IF
HE HAS A HALF HOUR SHOW. WE CAN'T CROSS-EXAMINE THAT. I'M SURE MR.
SIMPSON, AS HE SEES THAT INTERVIEW, WILL SAY, WAIT A MINUTE, THEY CUT
THIS OTHER PART OUT THAT I SAID. IF WE HAVE ROY FIRESTONE -- OTHERWISE
IT IS BASICALLY HEARSAY, A FORM OF HEARSAY. IF WE HAVE ROY FIRESTONE, I
CAN ASK HIM DIDN'T MR. SIMPSON SAY SO AND SO IN ADDITION TO THAT? SO WE
DON'T HAVE THAT. THAT IS MY FIRST OBJECTION TO THIS. I THINK AGAIN IT
SEEMS LIKE IT IS MUCH TO DO ABOUT NOTHING, BUT IT SEEMS HERE IS AN
INTERVIEW IN '89 WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO SHOW THE TAPE WITHOUT ROY
FIRESTONE, AND JUDGE, I THINK WE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO HAVE MR. FIRESTONE
AS PART OF THEIR CASE BECAUSE, OTHERWISE IT IS HEARSAY, I CANNOT
CROSS-EXAMINE OR SHOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS PARTICULAR TAPE, AND I
THINK THAT IS UNFAIR TO THE DEFENDANT. WE ARE DEPRIVED OF OUR
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IN THAT REGARD.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOUR COMMENTS ON THE 911 TAPE?

*MR. COCHRAN:* 911 TAPE, YOUR HONOR, I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED TO HEAR
MR. DARDEN SAY HE IS GOING TO CLEAN THAT UP. NOW, HERE WE ARE --

*MR. DARDEN:* I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* CUT SOMETHING OUT OF.

*MR. DARDEN:* I DIDN'T SAY THAT EITHER.

*MR. COCHRAN:* DON'T TALK TO ME. YOUR HONOR, I'M TALKING ONLY TO THE
COURT. I THOUGHT THAT MR. DARDEN SAID SOMETHING ABOUT CLEANING SOMETHING
UP OR WHATEVER. WE DON'T WANT THAT TAPE ALTERED AND I'M TELLING YOU,
YOUR HONOR, YOU I'M SURE YOU HEARD A LOT OF TAPES IN YOUR LIFE, AND FOR
HIM TO HAVE GOTTEN UP AND SAID THOSE WERE SLAPS, I THINK THAT THAT IS
GOING TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK THAT ANY DISPATCHER CAN TALK
ABOUT THESE BEING SLAPS. I THINK WE HAVE A FURTHER HEARING REGARDING
THAT PERSON'S QUALIFICATION BASED UPON THE TAPE THAT WE GAVE HEARD. I
WOULD ASK THE COURT WHETHER OR NOT THIS COURT IS PREPARED TO ALLOW
ANYBODY TO TESTIFY THOSE ARE SLAPS. CERTAINLY DIDN'T SOUND THAT WAY TO ME.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE SCREAMING WOMAN
IN THE BACKGROUND?

*MR. COCHRAN:* WELL, I DON'T -- OH, NO. I MEAN, IF THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO
WAS SCREAMING, IF IT IS IDENTIFIED WITH THIS CASE WHEN YOU SAY YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH IT, I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE THAT, OF COURSE, BUT I MEAN,
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THEIR ORDER OF
PROOF, IF THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO, BUT HE GOT UP AND TOLD THE
JURY THEY WERE GOING TO PROVE SLAPS. I DON'T HEAR THAT. AND THEN HE
TELLS US THAT THE DISPATCHER CAN HEAR IT, HE CAN HEAR IT AND HE IS GOING
TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, AND I DON'T THINK THAT IS TRUE
AT ALL. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE 403 HEARINGS, SO I DO OBJECT BASED ON THAT,
YOUR HONOR, UNTIL IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS RELEVANT AND UNTIL IT IS
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT SPECULATIVE. AND YOUR HONOR, I WANT YOU TO NOTE,
I'M NOT ASKING TO REOPEN MY OPENING STATEMENT TO SAY HE MISLED THIS
JURY. SOMETIME OR OTHER WE HAVE GOT TO TRY THIS CASE, DON'T WE?

*THE COURT:* BOY, I HOPE SO. MR. DARDEN, LET ME ASK YOU THIS: AS TO THE
ROY FIRESTONE TAPE, I SEEM TO RECALL THAT I SUSTAINED OBJECTIONS TO THE
DEFENSE USING A MONTAGE OF VIDEOTAPES WHICH I COULD TELL WERE THE CRIME
SCENE AT BUNDY. I RECOGNIZE THE PERSONS WHO WERE THERE, BUT WE DON'T
KNOW WHERE, WHEN, HOW AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE OUTTAKES, AND THERE IS
A FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEM WITH IT THAT THE PROSECUTION ADVANCED AND I
SUSTAINED THAT OBJECTION IN YOUR BEHALF. MR. COCHRAN RAISES THE SAME
OBJECTION TO THE FIRESTONE VIDEOTAPE. IT IS APPARENT WHO IS THERE. IT IS
MR. SIMPSON, IT IS MR. FIRESTONE AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE '89
INCIDENT. BUT THERE IS STILL AN AUTHENTICATION FOUNDATION THAT HAS TO BE
LAID. IT IS NOT INHERENTLY SELF-AUTHENTICATING.

*MR. DARDEN:* I THINK THAT IT IS IN, YOUR HONOR, IN DISCOVERY AND DURING
THE DV HEARING I PROVIDED THE COURT AND COUNSEL WITH A COMPLETE COPY OF
THE PROGRAM, YOUR HONOR, AND THAT IS A PORTION OF THAT PROGRAM, AND SO
WHATEVER CONCERN MR. COCHRAN MAY HAVE THEN REGARDING THE AUTHENTICATION
OF THAT PARTICULAR TAPE, IT IS -- THERE IS NO ISSUE THERE AND YOU CAN'T
CROSS-EXAMINE A VIDEOTAPE. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

*THE COURT:* WELL, HERE IS THE PROBLEM, *MR. DARDEN:* THERE IS AN
OBJECTION, THERE IS A FOUNDATIONAL OBJECTION IS WHAT I'M HEARING FROM
MR. COCHRAN.

*MR. DARDEN:* WHAT IS THE OBJECTION? HE HAS THE COMPLETE PROGRAM AND I
WANT TO PLAY A PORTION OF IT. I HAVE NO DUTY TO PLAY THE ENTIRE PROGRAM,
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT RELEVANT TO THESE PROCEEDINGS,
AND SO I WANT TO PLAY FOUR MINUTES OF THAT PROGRAM THAT RELATES DIRECTLY
FOR AN INCIDENT WHICH THE COURT HAS AGREED IS RELEVANT AND ADMISSIBLE IN
THIS CASE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WELL, MR. DARDEN, LET'S ASSUME THAT I DON'T BUY
THE ARGUMENT THAT IT IS SELF-AUTHENTICATING. WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

*MR. DARDEN:* YOU ARE THE JUDGE. THAT IS WHERE IT LEAVES US. I SAY IT
IS. I SAY THE EVIDENCE CODE WOULD LIKELY AGREE WITH ME. I MEAN, IT IS A
PORTION OF A COMPLETE T.V. PROGRAM WHICH THE COURT HAS SEEN.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WELL, DO YOU WANT TO --

*MR. DARDEN:* WHICH MR. COCHRAN HAS SEEN.

*THE COURT:* I HAVE THE EVIDENCE CODE BEFORE ME. DO YOU WANT TO CITE ME
TO A CODE SECTION THAT SAYS THAT VIDEOTAPES ARE SELF-AUTHENTICATING?

*MR. DARDEN:* NO, NO, I DON'T.

*THE COURT:* YOU PUT ME IN --

*MR. DARDEN:* IT IS LIKE ANY OTHER WRITING, OKAY? VIDEOTAPES, LIKE
WRITINGS, CAN BE SELF-AUTHENTICATING. YOU HAVE THE DATE OF THE INTERVIEW
RIGHT THERE. WE RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE IN THE VIDEOTAPE. THEY ARE
IDENTIFIED IN THE VIDEOTAPE, OKAY? WE KNOW THE DATE THAT IT WAS AIRED.
WE KNOW IT IS A ESPN VIDEO.

*THE COURT:* I AGREE WITH YOU. I KNOW ALL THESE THINGS. THE PROBLEM IS
THEY ARE OBJECTING.

(DISCUSSION HELD OFF THE RECORD BETWEEN THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.)

*MR. DARDEN:* I'M HELPING THEM OUT. I AM TRYING TO SHOW THEM WHERE THEY
ARE WRONG.

*THE COURT:* OKAY.

*MR. DARDEN:* LOOK AT THE VIDEOTAPE, THE CONTENT OF IT. YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO PRODUCED IT, YOU WANT TO KNOW THE DATE OF INTERVIEW, YOU WANT TO
KNOW THE SUBJECT MATTER, YOU WANT TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE INTERVIEW AND
INTERVIEWEE, IT IS ALL RIGHT THERE. WHAT CAN BE MORE AUTHENTICATING THAN
THAT? IT IS RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF US.

*THE COURT:* WELL, ISN'T WHAT IS IN THERE, THE DATE ON IT, HEARSAY,
UNTIL SOMEBODY AUTHENTICATES IT?

*MR. DARDEN:* NO. WOULD IT BE IN A LETTER? COULDN'T A LETTER BE
SELF-AUTHENTICATING?

*THE COURT:* DEPENDS ON WHAT THE LETTER IS.

*MR. DARDEN:* DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO COME IN AND AUTHENTICATE THE DATE? I
MEAN, THE LETTER SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, JUST LIKE THE VIDEOTAPE SPEAKS FOR
ITSELF.

*THE COURT:* WE JUST CAN'T BRING IN LETTERS. SOMEBODY HAS TO TESTIFY WHO
WROTE IT, WHOSE HANDWRITING IT IS.

*MS. CLARK:* EXCEPT IN THIS CASE.

*MR. DARDEN:* EXCEPT IN THIS CASE YOU DON'T NEED THAT BECAUSE YOU SEE
THE FACES OF THE PERSONS WHO ARE SPEAKING. YOU SEE THE FACE OF THE
PERSON WHO IS ASKING THE QUESTIONS. IF YOU WANT SOMEONE FROM ESPN IN
HERE, FINE, OKAY. I MEAN THAT IS FINE. THAT IS NO PROBLEM. I WILL GET
SOMEONE.

*THE COURT:* NO, IT IS NOT ME WHO WANTS IT. THEY ARE RAISING THE
OBJECTION. I WOULD JUST AS SOON LEAVE ESPN PEOPLE AT HOME.

*MR. DARDEN:* SURE. I WILL GET A CLERK TO COME IN AND SAY THIS IS A
PROGRAM THAT AIRED AT ESPN, THIS IS A T.V. PROGRAM, THIS IS OUR
VIDEOTAPE, IT IS A TRUE COPY AND THAT IS THAT AND THAT IS ALL THAT IS
REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THE SCREAMING WOMAN
ASPECT, THE SLAPPING ASPECT OF THE SCREAMING WOMAN TAPE?

*MR. DARDEN:* WELL, I THINK THAT LAY PEOPLE CAN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS. I'M
NOT GOING TO CUT THE TAPE OR ALTER THE TAPE SO THAT YOU CAN HEAR SLAPS.
I'M SIMPLY GOING TO ADJUST THE DIALS ON THE TAPE-RECORDER HERE. IF THERE
ARE NO SLAPS, THE JURY WILL FIGURE THAT OUT, BUT LET ME ADD THIS: YOU
HAVE THE TAPE OF THE SCREAMING WOMAN, YOU HAVE THE -- YOU HAVE THE
OPERATOR SAYING THAT THE CALL ORIGINATES FROM 360 NORTH ROCKINGHAM AND
YOU HAVE HER DISPATCHING POLICE CARS TO THAT LOCATION. YOU HAVE OFFICERS
ARRIVING MOMENTS LATER, YOU HAVE NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON WHO HAS EVIDENCE
-- PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, PHYSICAL PROOF OF HAVING BEEN SLAPPED, PLUS YOU
HAVE HER SPONTANEOUS STATEMENTS, OKAY? AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I THINK, A, YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR
SLAPS AS WE ADJUST THE KNOBS ON THE TAPE, BUT THEN AGAIN, THERE IS ALSO
PHYSICAL PROOF THAT THE DEFENDANT SLAPPED HER. AND HE ADMITTED IT LATER
ON. HE ADMITTED HARMING HER IN HIS LETTERS TO HER, SO WHAT IS THE ISSUE?
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM, MR. COCHRAN?

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. COCHRAN:* MAY I RESPOND, YOUR HONOR?

*THE COURT:* BRIEFLY.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I WILL TELL HIM WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. THE PROBLEM IS THE
EVIDENCE CODE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, THAT IS THE PROBLEM, AND
HEARSAY AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT. I MEAN, IT IS PRODUCTIVE TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR SLAPS. HE HAS TOLD THE JURY THAT ALREADY. WE
HAVE ALL HEARD THIS TAPE, AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HEAR SLAPS. IT IS A
MATTER OF INTERPRETATION. WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE VERY CLEAR, YOUR
HONOR, THAT COUNSEL NEEDS TO READ THE EVIDENCE CODE WITH REGARD TO THAT
VIDEOTAPE AND REGARDING HIS ANALYSIS OF THAT. AND A LETTER, THAT IS NOT
FOUNDATIONAL, AND I THINK WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM AND I DON'T THINK YOU
CAN JUST BRING A CLERK IN HERE. WE ARE GOING TO OBJECT IF HE BRINGS A
CLERK IN HERE TO TRY TO LAY SOME FOUNDATION FOR THIS PARTICULAR TAPE. AS
YOU CORRECTLY POINTED OUT, JUDGE, WHEN WE WERE SEEKING TO SHOW A TAPE
WHICH EVERYBODY HAD SEEN AT THE SCENE, THE COURT KEPT THAT OUT ON
VARIOUS GROUNDS, BUT IT WAS A MONTAGE. THESE THINGS ARE CUT, PASTED, PUT
TOGETHER, AND IT IS A REAL PROBLEM IF WE DON'T HAVE THE PERSON WHO DID
THE CUT AND PASTING, IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TRUTH AND GETTING THE
FACTS OUT TO THE JURORS, IN WHICH THEY CLAIM THEY WANT TO DO, SO I WOULD
-- I WOULD RESERVE FURTHER OBJECTION. AND I WAS REMINDED WHEN I RETURNED
TO MY SEAT THAT WHAT COUNSEL HAD INDICATED WAS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO
FILTER OR SOMETHING, USE THE WORDS "FILTER" WITH REGARDS TO THIS NOISE.
WE ARE ENTITLED TO HAVE THAT TAPE JUST THE WAY IT IS, NOT ENHANCED, AND
NOT FIDDLING WITH THE KNOBS, BUT THE WAY WE HEARD IT THERE, NOT SO THAT
THEY CAN BRING UP SOMETHING TO TRY TO PROVE SOMETHING. FURTHER, THERE IS
A FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEM WITH THAT TAPE. THE ADDRESS, I THINK IT WAS 360
ROCKINGHAM, APARTMENT B, AND THERE IS NO APARTMENTS AT THAT LOCATION AND
THERE ARE NO APARTMENTS AT 360 ROCKINGHAM. I DON'T KNOW -- I'M NOT CLEAR
ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH REGARD TO THAT, BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE
SOME FURTHER FOUNDATIONAL THINGS. AND I APPRECIATE THE COURT -- THAT IS
WHY WE HAVE THESE HEARINGS, BUT COUNSEL HAS NOT GIVEN YOU -- YOU ASKED
HIM FOR A CASE, YOU ASKED HIM FOR A CITE WITH REGARD TO THE VIDEOTAPE,
AND YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS INHERENT WITH THIS TAPE, AND THEY HAVEN'T EVEN
CALLED THEIR FIRST WITNESS YET, JUDGE, AND THESE ARE THE PROBLEMS THEY
ARE HAVING WITH THIS EVIDENCE.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, COUNSEL. MR. DARDEN, I THINK YOU HAVE
-- I ACCEPT YOUR OFFER OF PROOF THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE
DISPATCHER COME IN WHO WAS THE PERSON WHO TOOK THIS CALL, CORRECT?

*MR. DARDEN:* YES.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. DARDEN:* SHE WILL EXPLAIN, I'M SURE NOT TO MR. COCHRAN'S
SATISFACTION, BUT I'M SURE TO EVERYBODY ELSE'S, AND SHE WILL
AUTHENTICATE THE TAPE AND SHE WILL ALSO INDICATE THAT AS SHE LISTENED TO
THE SLAPS AND THE BEATING THAT SHE TYPED INTO HER KEYBOARD THERE
CONTEMPORANEOUSLY THAT FACT, THE FACT THAT SHE COULD HEAR THE WOMAN
BEING BEATEN.

*THE COURT:* IS THAT PART OF OUR RECORD OF DISCOVERY? HAS THAT BEEN
TURNED OVER TO THE DEFENSE?

*MR. DARDEN:* ABSOLUTELY, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT, YOUR HONOR.

*MR. DARDEN:* HE SHOULD READ HIS DISCOVERY.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I HAVE NOT SEEN IT. FURTHERMORE, THE FACT --

*MR. DARDEN:* HE HASN'T READ IT.

*THE COURT:* HOLD ON. I'M TALKING TO MR. DARDEN RIGHT NOW, MR. COCHRAN.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I THOUGHT YOU ASKED ME.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT.

*MR. DARDEN:* OF COURSE IT IS PART OF THE DISCOVERY, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. MR. DARDEN, ACCEPTING YOUR REPRESENTATION THAT
YOU WILL HAVE THE DISPATCHER HERE WHO WILL AUTHENTICATE THE TAPE, I'M
GOING TO OVERRULE THE OBJECTION AT THIS TIME.

*MR. DARDEN:* THANK YOU.

*THE COURT:* HOWEVER, THE TAPE APPEARS TO ME TO BE OVERLY LONG BECAUSE
IT GOES ON TO OTHER THINGS AND OTHER INCIDENTS AND OTHER -- HOW FAR --
HOW FAR INTO THE TAPE DO WE GET THE ACTUAL DISPATCH OF THE UNIT?

*MR. DARDEN:* THAT PROCESS FROM THE TIME THAT YOU HEAR THE FIRST SCREAM
UNTIL YOU HEAR THE DISPATCHER NOTIFYING POLICE UNITS.

*THE COURT:* ANY WEST L.A. UNIT, 360 NORTH ROCKINGHAM CODE 2?

*MR. DARDEN:* RIGHT, IS ABOUT THREE MINUTES, AND THE PROBLEM HERE IS
THAT THE DISPATCHER RECEIVES THE CALL, SHE HEARS THE SCREAMING, AND AS I
UNDERSTAND IT, THE LINE IS LEFT OPEN, OKAY, AND SO ALTHOUGH YOU MAY HERE
OTHER DISPATCHERS COMING ON AND DISPATCHING OTHER UNITS TO OTHER
LOCATIONS IN OTHER MATTERS, THE LINE IS LEFT OPEN AND THE DISPATCHER IS
STILL LISTENING IN.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THE TAPE IS RELEVANT UP UNTIL THE POINT WHERE
THE CAR IS DISPATCHED, BUT THERE IS A LOT OF EXTRANEOUS STUFF THAT IS
GOING ON THERE, SO WHAT I'M TELLING YOU, I'M GOING TO LET YOU PLAY THE
FIRST PART OF IT UP UNTIL WE GET TO THE ACTUAL DISPATCH OF THE CAR,
BECAUSE I THINK THAT PRETTY MUCH ENDS THE RELEVANCE OF THE TAPE.

*MR. DARDEN:* YOU ARE SAYING ONCE THE CARS ARE DISPATCHED TO ROCKINGHAM,
END THE TAPE?

*THE COURT:* RIGHT.

*MR. DARDEN:* FINE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I HAVE A QUESTION, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* YES.

*MR. COCHRAN:* IS THE COURT ALLOWING THE DISPATCHER TO SAY SHE HEARD
SLAPS? WE OBJECT TO THAT. I DON'T THINK YOU RULED ON THAT YET. HOW DOES
SHE -- IS SHE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION?

*THE COURT:* LET'S TALK TO HER WHEN SHE GETS HERE OUT OF THE PRESENCE.

*MR. COCHRAN:* I THINK ON VOIR DIRE I WOULD ASK COUNSEL NOT TO GO INTO
THAT.

*THE COURT:* MR. DARDEN, WHY DON'T YOU PULL UP THE SHEETS THAT YOU HAVE
ON HER NOTES AND WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT TOMORROW MORNING. ALL RIGHT.

*MR. DARDEN:* UH-HUH.

*MR. COCHRAN:* WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, YOUR HONOR, WHO WAS SLAPPING WHOM IN
THAT TAPE?

*THE COURT:* I DON'T KNOW.

*MR. DARDEN:* LOOKS LIKE THE DEFENDANT WAS SLAPPING NICOLE. THAT MAY BE
THE POINT IN TIME WHEN HE GRABBED HER AROUND THE NECK AND LEFT THE HAND
IMPRINT. I DON'T KNOW.

*THE COURT:* ALL RIGHT. THAT IS ENOUGH, COUNSEL. ALL RIGHT. AS TO THE
FIRESTONE TAPE, I'M GOING TO SUSTAIN THE FOUNDATIONAL OBJECTION SUBJECT
TO FURTHER PROOF.

*MR. COCHRAN:* THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

*THE COURT:* OKAY. TOMORROW MORNING THEN. SO THAT WE ARE CLEAR, TOMORROW
MORNING AT 9:00 A.M. THE PROSECUTION WILL HAVE TEN MINUTES TO BRIEFLY
REOPEN THEIR OPENING STATEMENT, THEN WE WILL PROCEED TO THE PRESENTATION
OF EVIDENCE.

*MR. DARDEN:* TEN MINUTES IN ADDITION TO ANY PORTION OF THE --

*THE COURT:* YES, IN ADDITION TO THE --

*MR. DARDEN:* -- EXERCISE VIDEO?

*THE COURT:* FOUR MINUTES OF VIDEOTAPE THAT IS RELEVANT.

*MR. BAILEY:* MAY WE SEE THE COURT AT THE BENCH FOR ONE MINUTE?

*THE COURT:* DO YOU WANT THE REPORTER?

*MR. BAILEY:* NO.

*THE COURT:* WE ARE IN RECESS.

*MS. CLARK:* JUST FOR THE RECORD, I WANT TO CLARIFY THE COURT'S RULING
WITH RESPECT TO SUSTAINING THE DEFENSE OBJECTION TO ADDRESSING THE
BLOOD. IS THE COURT MAKING A FINDING THAT THE DEFENSE POINT WAS NOT
MISLEADING?

*THE COURT:* NO. I'M MAKING A FINDING THAT WE HAD TWO DAYS OF SHOW AND
TELL, THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS MANY LAWYERS AVAILABLE, AT LEAST TWO,
PERHAPS THREE WHO WERE ASSIGNED THE BLOOD EVIDENCE, THAT THE PURPOSE OF
THE SHOW AND TELL WAS FOR COUNSEL TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS AND TO RAISE
ANY OBJECTIONS. NO OBJECTION WAS RAISED. IT IS TOO LATE AT THIS POINT IN
TIME TO ASK TO REOPEN AS TO THAT ISSUE. THAT IS THE REASON FOR THE
COURT'S RULING.

*MS. CLARK:* BUT HOW WOULD WE HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS GOING TO --

*THE COURT:* YOU ARE JUST ASKING ME FOR THE RULING, COUNSEL; NOT
ARGUING. ALL RIGHT. I WILL SEE COUNSEL AT SIDE BAR.
